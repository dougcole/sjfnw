  <a class ="FAQ" onclick="toggle('file_problems')">Unable to upload file(s)</a>
  <div class="indent hidden" id="file_problems">
    If you are using Internet Explorer 9:<br>
    Unfortunately there is a <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2601307" target="_blank">known bug</a> in some versions of IE9 that prevent our file upload system from working.  Microsoft suggests a <a href="http://update.microsoft.com" target="_blank">security update</a>.  You can also try using <a href="https://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/browser/" target="_blank">Chrome</a> or <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/" target="_blank">Firefox</a>.
    <br><br>

  <a class ="FAQ" onclick="toggle('simul_editing')">Warning: simultaneous editing</a>
  <div class="indent hidden" id="simul_editing">
    A grant application draft should only be edited by one person at a time.  Multiple users editing an application at the same time will result in changes being overwritten and lost.
    <br><br>
    To prevent this from happening accidentally, we implemented a confirmation window any time there is a risk of overwrite.
    <br><br>
    Seeing this warning does not necessarily mean someone else is using your login.  You may have left the page open in another tab, browser, or on another computer.
  </div>

  <a class ="FAQ" onclick="toggle('error_filetype')">Error message: file type not supported</a>
  <div class="indent hidden" id="error_filetype">
    The following file types are supported:
    <div class="indent">doc/docx, xls/xlsx, ppt/pptx, pdf, txt, jpeg/jpg, png, gif, bmp</div>
    If you saw this error despite using one of those types, or if you believe a file type should be added to that list, please contact us.
  </div>

  <a class ="FAQ" onclick="toggle('error_timeone')">Error message: request timeout</a>
  <div class="indent hidden" id="error_timeone">
    A timeout error generally means that the server is temporarily overloaded and could not handle the request.  If you see this message, wait a minute or two and try again.  If you continue to get this message, <a onclick="trackSupport('form');" href="{{support_form}}{{request.user.username}}" target="_blank">file a bug report</a>.
