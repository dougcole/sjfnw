<h3>Are you sure you want to revert this application into a draft?</h3>
<br>
<p><b>{{application}} - {{application.grant_cycle}} - submitted {{application.submission_time}}</b></p>
<p>This will <strong>delete the application</strong> and replace it with a draft, allowing staff or the organization to make edits.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Screening status and scoring bonuses will be reset to defaults.</li>
  <li><strong>Any logs associated with this particular application will be deleted.</strong> Aisa is working on a fix for this. In the meantime, contact her if you need to change something in the application but don't want to revert and lose logs.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you proceed, you will be redirected to the draft page once the conversion has finished, where you can extend the submission deadline if needed.</p>
