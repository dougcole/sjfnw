A higher fish consumption rate results in a lower amount of allowed pollution/toxics that will be discharged into water and better protection of our health.

It establishes strong community partnerships to support, educate, train, link and facilitate educating inmates about organic gardening, nutrition and sustainable environmental practices.  We do this through the curriculum called Seed to Supper program from the Oregon Food Bank, and by teaching and training inmates to acquire the through sustainable gardening classes from Oregon State University (OSU) leading to the Home Horticulture credential. The gardens produced 200,000 pounds of freash food for prison kitchens in 2012.  Those gardens also provide food for the hungry in Oregon, by donating 20,000 pounds of produce to the Oregon Food Bank and Marion Polk Food Share in Salem in 2012.

The adverse effects of this history carried down from generation to generation are known as historical trauma. Within these dysfunctional levels of trauma, the indigenous kinship roles have been altered along with manifesting historical trauma and displacing the two-spirits from their own communities. Wisdom of the Elders has created a unique multimedia project in response to the discovery of historical trauma. The videos and teachings form a culturally tailored curriculum that fits the unique learning style of Native Americans. Sharing stories is a traditional native practice that provides a vehicle for learning and healing. We know that life is a difficult journey, one that causes some people to become lost along the way. In the video recordings and health and wellness teachings, tribal elders and storytellers reveal how they experienced being \\u201clost,\\u201d and they share how they found their way to eventually return to a meaningful life. These teachings integrate positive identity development with building healthy relationships, encouraging appropriate conduct and skills development, and the restoring of traditional cultural values back into our family relationships. It provides hope for those affected by historical trauma, not just Native people, but all peoples, including two-spirits. Native people manifest stories of internalized ancestral trauma in the personal stories of their life. They demonstrate how trauma continues today to be unintentionally passed down to generations of Native American elders, adults, children and two-spirits who continue to suffer from multiple issues. Although this will continue to be felt for years to come, many Native leaders serve as role models to our people who are beginning to overcome the high rates of addictions, domestic violence, sexual abuse and homophobia. Research indicates that historical pain becomes even more painful when it seems to be forgotten, trivialized, or denied. As we strive to end violence against all people, we have focused the vulnerable: Native women, children, and elders. We are now expanding our initiatives to develop a capacity and community support for the LGBTQ2S communities. Which include composing a Two-Spirit Allies Coalition to gather all the Native American serving organizations who advocate for the Native LGBTQ2S community members.  The Discovering Our Story video productions and lessons being provided at WISDOM\\u2019s website over the next three years are being created to help them, their extended families, and others as they re-awaken their identity, remember their own story and create their own career pathway plan. Our new initiatives are to emphasize the stories of the LGBTQ2S\\u2019 and create curriculums to be utilized within the school systems and to educate at multi-generational levels.  \\r\\n\\r\\n\", \"amount_requested\": \"\", \"zip\": \"97266\", \"timeline_9\": \"7/1/13-6/30/14\", \"timeline_6\": \"8/1/13-6/30/14\", \"timeline_7\": \"-Disseminate Portland Two Spirit Society's printed and social media to promote Native American Two-Spirit families\", \"timeline_4\": \"-Create LGBTQ2S \\\"Discovering Our Stories\\\" \\r\\n-Interview adult and elder two-spirit Native Americans\\r\\n-Compose curriculum and media campaing\", \"timeline_5\": \"Goal: Compose LGBTQ2S component of \\\"Discovering Our Story.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nObjective: To educate and advocate for the Two-Spirit way of life. \", \"support_type\": \"\", \"timeline_3\": \"7/1/13-6/30/14\", \"timeline_0\": \"7/1/13-6/30/14\", \"timeline_1\": \"-Informational Interview with Portland Two Spirit Society & IWOK project managers.\\r\\n-Collaborate with community partners and host a Two-Spirit ally function. \\r\\n-\\r\\nLGBTQ2S Coalition meetings\", \"racial_justice_ref1_name\": \"\", \"state\": \"OR\", \"project_budget\": \"\", \"collab_ref2_name\": \"Amanda Wright\", \"racial_justice_ref2_name\": \"\", \"collab_ref2_phone\": \"504-467-1258\", \"website\": \"\", \"fiscal_zip\": \"\", \"start_year\": \"\", \"contact_person_title\": \"Project Coordinator\", \"narrative4\": \"Our work plan is composed of activities to strengthen our out-reach of advocay as well as collaborating with local allies and regional Two-Spirits.

We currently have produced our fourth series of American Indian public radio programs.  We have shared rare cultural arts content along with sustainability responses of tribal communities that are in the midst of unprecedented environmental degradation and climate change. This holistic cultural and science series has featured the voices of traditional Native American elders, storytellers, musicians, educators and traditional scientists from eight tribal communities in Alaska, Washington, Oregon, and Idaho. The proposed Twpo-Spirit series will include several segments each featuring homophobia, social injustice, gender and age discrimination from a LGBTQ2S stand point and community preparedness efforts relevant to strengthening our Two-Spirit allies within our communities. We will also introduce an artistic content, along with the wisdom and observations of tribal elders and  role models with traditional stories, music and dance, and cultural values.\\r\\n\\r\\nOur assessments will be delivered through a community participatory effort.

From birth to death, Portland's Native Americans experience barriers to adequate health, education and prosperity. 2011 statistics of our Native community shows significantly worse outcomes than Caucasians on every social determinant of health (income, food, housing, employment, education, environment and health care). \\r\\n\\r\\nThe Native youth high school annual dropout rate is 20%, with 30+% cumulatively (An Unsettling Profile, Coalition of Communities of Color and PSU, 2011). As a group, Native students enter school with measurably lower social, personal and cognitive development than other children in Oregon (Oregon Department of Education). Only 37% of Native high school students in Portland graduate on time (Portland Schools Foundation 2006). American Indians now earn a lower percentage of the state's college degrees than they did in 1997 (Oregon University System 2007).\\r\\n\\r\\nIn any event that our collaborations cross issue or constituency lines, the community out reach becomes stronger and allows our project initiatives to successfully completed. \", \"narrative6\": \"With our mission and projects, Wisdom seeks to correct misconceptions, end prejudice, bring health and wellness to Native people, and demonstrate how Indian culture has and is continuing to enrich our worlds.

These three organizations will partner to create a year long advisory council of queer youth of color (with an emphasis on homeless youth). This advisory council will create ongoing community building events for queer youth of color, create a written resource in the form of a zine, and lastly create a survey to address the needs of this community in Portland. \\r\\n   These three organizations imagine creating a leadership council lead by youth most heavily impacted by racism, homelessness and homo/transphobia. These youth, with the support of Black PFLAG's Youth Coordinator will make a plan to assess the needs of queer youth of color, meeting those needs, and creating a longer-term plan for this council. The council members would be provided with stipends, work experience, and letters of recommendation/support in attaining employment.\\r\\n  In addition to creating a survey, the youth advisory council would plan and facilitate bi-monthly Queer Youth of Color Family Dinner Nights at SMYRC. On these nights, youth would come together with adult volunteers (queer adults of color) to cook intergenerational dinners. On these nights volunteers and staff would connect youth to resources, provide support and hand out hygiene and food packages.\\r\\n     Our objectives for the year would be to create a community of youth supporting youth of color. We will assess our success by checking in with our youth advisory council's goals throughout the year, having 200 youth fill out the survey, and having 15 youth on average attend the family dinner nights. \", \"narrative5\": \"\", \"narrative6\": \"\", \"collab_ref2_org\": \"\", \"collab_ref1_org\": \"\", \"fax_number\": \"\", \"budget_last\": \"\", \"fiscal_state\": \"\", \"collab_ref2_email\": \"\", \"racial_justice_ref2_email\": \"\", \"address\": \"\", \"racial_justice_ref2_org\": \"\", \"fiscal_email\": \"\", \"narrative2\": \"\", \"grant_period\": \"\", \"racial_justice_ref1_phone\": \"\", \"previous_grants\": \"\", \"grant_request\": \"\", \"fiscal_person\": \"\", \"fiscal_org\": \"\", \"project_title\": \"\", \"racial_justice_ref2_phone\": \"\", \"budget_current\": \"\", \"fiscal_address\": \"\", \"telephone_number\": \"\", \"collab_ref1_email\": \"\", \"racial_justice_ref1_org\": \"\", \"timeline_14\": \"Begin to transition into plan for Year 2 (whether it is youth-led, intern-led or grants have been established for paid staff)\\r\\nReflect on overall success of program and whether we have achieved our goals.\", \"timeline_8\": \"Reflecting on the results of the survey and deciding what can be accomplished in January-July. \\r\\nSetting clear goals.\", \"contact_person\": \"\", \"ein\": \"\"}",

NAYA began as a grassroots effort by community members in 1974 and currently employs 134 staff, owns and operates a 10.5 acre campus in NE Portland and uses the Relational Worldview Model (RWM) as an organizational theory of change. The RWM is a reflection of the Native thought process and concept of balance as the basis for health, whether that is an individual, family or an organization. NAYA believes that understanding this worldview is essential in working with Native American and Alaska Native (NA/AN) individuals and families, and in the empowerment of the NA/AN community to choose, form and shape their own destiny. The fundamental lens and perspective through which NAYA provides all of its programs and services to individuals and families, is based on the RWM developed in partnership with the National Indian Child Welfare Association (NICWA) (http://www.nicwa.org/Relational_Worldview/). The process included a community participatory research methods which lead in part to the creation of the Portland Youth and Elders Council (PYEC) in 2004. The PYEC emerged from community priorities to eliminate poverty in Indian country through a focus on community economic development, employment, housing, and civic engagement. The advocacy efforts of NAYA and PYEC include making Native American issues a priority in our community believing that when Native Americans succeed the entire community succeeds. The PYEC has a unique role in advising NAYA Family Center in strategic planning and builds on community strength and knowledge through the practice of culture, values, and traditions.

Without this foundational work, it is likely that practices that perpetuated ill-will and prevented effective partnerships from forming would have continued as the primary way in which  to engage the Native community (or worse yet, failed to engage). Trauma-informed collaboration requires public health organizations to closely examine and acknowledge the present-day effects of historical trauma on community-based approaches to intervention planning. Trauma-informed collaboration is a rich and often challenging process that bridges cultural paradigms and address root causes of mistrust between people and organizations. This effort requires a long-term approach, recognizing that building trust and strengthening partnerships are essential to reducing health inequities. As a result of the partnership with Multnomah County we have provided localized data on attitudes, knowledge and behaviors regarding healthy pregnancy planning and how culture contributes to good birth outcomes. We are increasing hidden voices in the community, elevating the priority of addressing health inequities of the Native community and building on current skills and knowledge to increase capacity of local Native community to engage in health promotion planning.

Soon it was evident that the working poor were at a loss for comprehensive health care, and the Board of Directors charged the staff with development of a full-scope primary care center, providing accessible, affordable, quality health care. \\r\\n \\r\\nYNHS has been awarded many contracts from the State of Washington to provide ongoing comprehensive health care for low-income and otherwise disadvantaged families.  For example, Maternal Child Health (MCH) grant funds were obtained to augment the clinic\\u2019s services to children ages 0-21 and pregnant women who were without health insurance or Medicaid and a state contract to provide WIC Supplemental Food and Nutrition Education Program for the Yakima Valley. The WIC program at YNHS has grown from 900 clients per month to our current caseload averaging 6,400 clients per month. \\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1992 YNHS applied for and achieved Federal designation as a Federally Qualified Health Center (FQHC). This special designation allows YNHS to receive financial support for enabling services such as interpreters, transportation, and education to families who could not otherwise access needed health care services.  Today, YNHS has a $15 million annual budget with 150 staff governed by a volunteer Board of Directors of whom at least 51% are consumers of the organization\\u2019s services. \\r\\nYNHS began targeted health services for homeless families and individuals in Yakima County in 2005 as a coordinated community response to ending homelessness through its \\\"Neighborhood Connections\\\" program that rolls out services with partnerships throughout the health and social service community.

Last year, YNHS served nearly 20,000 unduplicated patients.  Of these, 6,000 were uninsured,  13,500  had incomes below the federal poverty level;  and  6,000  preferred a language other than English.

These barriers include economic justice and social justice issues of income, social status, language and literacy supports, transportation and often service access due to rural and remote geographical limitations.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe root causes of these barriers are often grown out of generational poverty and lack of access to education and employment opportunities in a rural and often service lean environment.  YNHS has through its strategic goals and actions expanded services throughout Yakima County by opening additional clinics and use of mobile and nurse outreach programs to literally \\\"bring services to the individuals and families\\\" towards eliminating access barriers.  Community support groups have been formed supported with resources by YNHS to allow communities to develop and foster local peer supports and a sense of social empowerment and these groups are surveyed to improve services and program quality.  This has nurtured a building of community power to inform service design and scope and also to generate topics and educational tools to help patients take charge of their own health care and wellness individually and collectively.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlso, YNHS began targeted health services for homeless families and individuals in Yakima County. And In 2005 as a coordinated community response to ending homelessness through its \\\"Neighborhood Connections\\\" program YNHS rolled out services with partnerships throughout the health and social service community.  No coordinated and client informed services and programs existed.  These services include medical and dental care, recuperative respite care, behavioral health, case management, assistance with basic needs, housing and self sufficiency programs.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs a founding member of the Homeless Network of Yakima County, YNHS along with some 40+ nonprofits serving homeless persons, created a community standard assessment tool and intake process.  These community wide methods were used to identify client strengths and resources, barriers and/or needs for services, and to overall develop a customized approach to developing individual action plans emphasizing cultural competency and inclusive of client values and traditions.  This model embedded with skilled case management staff and stable housing tracks has been piloted and found successful with adults and families in Yakima County.  Through a community families transitional housing and supports project, YNHS was able to further integrate its homeless and health services by adapting the assessment tool (called the ASSM) into an Electronic Health Record (EHR) that is being used to collect data, examine benefits of health care and health education to client life improvements, skill set development and wellness.  These integrated and coordinated local resource distribution has demonstrated efficient and effective outcomes based on the defined success of the clients.

It is imperative that a focus of social justice to this federal infrastructure design.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Yakima County, many providers, including YNHS, have made the transition from paper to electronic records.  This initiative,  described as \\u201cMeaningful Use\\u201d is a three-phase national transition to 1) adopt and implement EHR to move health care communities to nationally certified systems that will be interoperable; 2) collect demographic and clinical data in recordable and transportable ways; and 3) use this clinical  data to assist health care providers improve health outcomes.   \\r\\n\\r\\nAn important part of the HITECH Act is patient engagement, and the ability of patients to be actively involved in their own health care, including communicating with providers through   \\u201cpatient portals\\u201d  - secure electronic access to the individual\\u2019s Electronic Health Record.

As part of this partnership YNHS has two distinct strategies related to increasing workforce diversity and client or patient work hiring programs that foster and integrate diverse populations into the local health care system to both improve the quality of care but to increase the diversity of the health care professional delivery system.\\r\\n\\r\\nFirst, YNHS is a local and regional partner with several universities, health professional technical colleges and schools to provide learning opportunities of students of health professions.  Through these state and local vocational programs and higher education degree programs students have internship and cross learning opportunities.\\r\\n\\r\\nSecond, YNHS also is an eligible loan repayment site for the National Health Services Corps where health professionals can receive student loan repayment for serving uninsured and disadvantaged populations.  This program increases the amount of fresh and energetic health professionals in the workforce to both share their talents and diversity with the Yakima area community.  \\r\\n\\r\\nFinally, YNHS sponsors many health professionals into the country to serve their required hours of practice in the United States to become licensed.

Together we have successfully reduced poverty by educating thousands of parents about their rights to public benefits and changing policies to increase accessibility at state welfare offices for folks with language and other barriers, held the line on harmful legislation like fraud prosecution, urinalysis, and some of the proposed cuts to vital services, and improved access to education and increased supports for parents with special needs children.  \\r\\n\\r\\nLast year through repeated media exposure and direct action, we pressured Chase Bank to stop charging an 85 cent fee each time recipients use their benefits cards and won a court ruling protecting free speech and protest rights at our state capitol.

Though 41% of single mother families live in poverty, only 10% receive welfare cash assistance, thanks to arbitrary time limits, excessive work requirements, and shrinking benefit levels.  Social assistance in the U.S. is both far below the average in comparison countries and far below the relative poverty standard.  Low-income parents often feel overwhelmed by our public benefit system, ashamed of their need for assistance, powerless over their situations, and isolated by the social stigma they face.  \\r\\n\\r\\nHegemony is further supported by the mainstream media that publishes article after article of \\\"welfare fraud\\\" stories while ignoring events where thousands are calling for change through direct action.  Fortunately, we have unprecedented access to alternative media and people through the creation of our own media.  Legislators responded by funding 6 new full-time Washington investigators who spent a year discovering that out of over 50,000 EBT card users, 67 used ATMs at undesirable establishments.

Our members build their skills to present informative anti-oppression workshops, multimedia, and direct action.  We assert that a key to social justice is a more equitable distribution of social and natural resources to ensure that all people have full opportunities for personal and social development. We work to create a world in which all people are valued, empowered, and have quality of life. We view racism, sexism, classism, ableism, and heterosexism as systemic, interrelated, and destructive.

The Montana Coalition for Safety and Justice began to operate in the legislative area in 2011 and has been successful in providing valuable testimony and support for those individuals who came forward to provide information to legislators.

The policies and regulations of the system create barriers and promote failure.  Each year, over 2000 children enter the juvenile justice system in Montana for the first time.  This equates to approximately 20% of the children born each year in Montana.  Many of these children will continue to be in the system as adults.  Some of the recent outcomes of our system can only leave when shaking their head 10-year-olds arrested and given $500,000 bail for missing\\u2019s and being disrespectful in school,  15-year-olds being sent to the adult prison and confined to solitary incarceration because it is too dangerous for them to be in the general population due to their age. \\r\\nOver 60% of the Montana prison population has been re- incarcerated for non-criminal violations of probation or parole.  The Montana parole and probation regulations are, unconstitutional and impossible to follow in many instances.  In Montana, a parolee or probationer can be re-incarcerated because they pay for utilities, which is considered a debt and having debt may be a reason for revocation of a parole or probation.  But failure to provide such necessities for your family is a violation of state law, which would result in re-incarceration. As crazy as it sounds, there are people in prison for going to the hospital, getting married, purchasing a puppy for their children, or simply being Native American.\\r\\nThe Coalition works to build collective power by organizing its constituency throughout the state in educating and supporting local initiative proposals to end discrimination in housing, education, employment, credit, voter rights and access to financial services solely based on criminal history.  On the state level we are the voice of our community.  In the last year, several of our supporting members who testified before the legislature or physically threatened by members of the parole board and corrections department personnel in an effort to intimidate and bar them from bringing their information to legislative committees.  As a Coalition we provide that voice as a group and protect  those who would be singled out for retribution for bringing their story to light.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy organizing it is not the individual that speaks but the organization, as an organization the current power structure can be effectively modified to effect housing, education and employment barriers. The strategy of education combined with organization provides information and incentive to change policies and bias that create long term negative effects on the families and children of ex-prisoners.

Legislative work is an ongoing task throughout the next year, and such work is done on a daily, weekly and monthly basis.  Our goal in the legislative task force is to have a minimum of three committee bills that remove barriers to reentry.\\r\\nAt a time appropriate between April and June 2014, it is our goal an intention to organize a day of action at the capital to bring attention to the injustice and the runaway costs of the correctional system.

Opening Doors works to build a foundation of mutual trust, respect between many organizations  that share similar ideals.  Opening Doors helped re-create the Reentry Task Force for Cascade County to address reentry issues locally and bring local resources to bear.  Opening doors is also worked hard to create long-lasting partnerships with community organizations that provide services and material support to individuals that fit our mutual demographics.  Through these partnerships we've increased the number of satellite food banks and rotation of material goods to organizations that can effectively distribute the materials to those in need.\\r\\nBecause opening doors has worked in many areas such as food distribution, housing issues, and employment issues, and economic empowerment issues that are not limited to those we serve, opening doors can call on other organizations only worked with to show a unified front for change.\\r\\nAn example of such a successful collaboration can be found in the coordinated advocacy activities to remove barriers to employment, post incarceration.  This collaboration consisted of the Montana Chamber Of Commerce, Landlords Association National Association for the Mentally Ill and Opening Doors.  Opening doors through the Montana coalition worked with voter registration groups to ensure and encourage our constituency to participate in the election process.  Although our success was not 100% in preventing the denial of the right to vote, we increased constituency turnout and participation.\\r\\n\", \"narrative6\": \"Our work in correctional system reform includes working on racial justice.  Native Americans are greatly overrepresented in the correctional system.  This overrepresentation is clearly seen at the Montana State women\\u2019s prison, where, over 72% of that prisons population is Native American.  By reforming the corrections system and in turn reforming the justice system, opening doors through the Montana coalition project works to organize and educate our elected representatives in the community at large in the disparity of sentencing, parole grants, re-incarceration\\u2019s, and law enforcement that statistically shows an unjustifiable focus on individuals based on their racial characteristics.  This is symptomatic of an underlying bias toward individuals of color.\\r\\nThis unstated bias can also be found in employment data that shows Native Americans and others of color are significantly overrepresented in unemployment and underemployment data.  Because of the disproportionate effect on minorities in employment and incarceration is created and economic injustice that is further compounded by an imbalance in parole and probation restrictions that cannot be justified by the underlying criminal activity.  Minority offenders and their families are often subjected to additional restrictions not imposed on white offenders.\\r\\nOur efforts to reform the criminal justice system and our inclusion at all levels of our leadership,  those most affected by these biases we give an example through personal action that such biases are unfounded and cannot be justified.  The Coalition has worked hard to volunteer efforts to compile over 10 years of data from parole, probation and criminal Justice statistics that confirm such bias exists.  Opening doors through the Coalition and its partners is working to remove that bias from the system.

These projects include Immigration Conversation Forums, English, Leadership and Technology classes, and a Women\\u2019s Group for Justice.\\r\\nOur accomplishments are characterized by local people designing and implementing changes needed in their community. A major accomplishment is exemplified by the Women\\u2019s Group for Justice. The group\\u2019s purpose is to foster solidarity and establish a safe place for women to be themselves. We witnessed the initiatives of low income, Spanish speaking women take shape. The women designed workshops, made partnerships, and planned events from what they knew their neighbors needed. The group identified the need for Latina woman to develop skills suitable for job opportunities. As a result, the women created the Empowering Latina Leaders in Action (ELLA) Program, which provides English, technology, and leadership classes to women in South Park. The group proposed the ELLA Program to the department of Neighborhoods and received a generous grant to implement the project.

Displacing people physically is gentrification, and laws that change a person\\u2019s access to opportunities and information. Psychological displacement occurs when communities begin to believe of themselves as \\u201cless than\\u201d and deserving of the \\u201cbad\\u201d things in life. These two components result in a lack of community participation, individualistic thinking, and internalized racism. \\r\\nOur organization directly shifts the power of information to people. We believe that communities should not be told what is good for them, but that they have all the information to decide what is good. In this way, community members see themselves as part of the bigger picture. Once community members gain access to information, they act upon what they know. Action happens by passing information onward, or using it to reclaim a part of them that had been displaced. At SPIARC, collective power takes shape when we form partnerships with other people and groups that have different skills to share. In South park there is a true sense of solidarity because community members recognize that we are all stakeholders. At SPIARC we have built collaboration with people who may be different from us, with groups that speak different languages and cultures.
