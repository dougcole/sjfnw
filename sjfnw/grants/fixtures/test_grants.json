You can create these modules with the Fragment class, which behaves somewhat like a nested activity that can define its own layout and manage its own lifecycle.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen a fragment specifies its own layout, it can be configured in different combinations with other fragments inside an activity to modify your layout configuration for different screen sizes (a small screen might show one fragment at a time, but a large screen can show two or more).\\r\\n\\r\\nThis class shows you how to create a dynamic user experience with fragments and optimize your app's user experience for devices with different screen sizes, all while continuing to support devices running versions as old as Android 1.6.\", \"fiscal_telephone\": \"\", \"racial_justice_ref1_email\": \"\", \"email_address\": \"as@gmail.com\", \"collab_ref1_name\": \"Robyn\", \"city\": \"sdaf\", \"amount_requested\": \"8965\", \"zip\": \"654\", \"project_budget\": \"\", \"collab_ref1_phone\": \"\", \"support_type\": \"General support\", \"collab_ref1_org\": \"Body Talk\", \"state\": \"WA\", \"fiscal_org\": \"\", \"collab_ref2_name\": \"Atlas\", \"racial_justice_ref2_name\": \"\", \"collab_ref2_phone\": \"555-298-9635\", \"website\": \"asdfsdaf\", \"narrative1\": \"Once a narrative, always a narrative.\", \"start_year\": \"January 1\", \"contact_person_title\": \"Senor Moose\", \"narrative4\": \"n a typical SSL usage scenario, a server is configured with a certificate containing a public key as well as a matching private key. As part of the handshake between an SSL client and server, the server proves it has the private key by signing its certificate with public-key cryptography.\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, anyone can generate their own certificate and private key, so a simple handshake doesn't prove anything about the server other than that the server knows the private key that matches the public key of the certificate. One way to solve this problem is to have the client have a set of one or more certificates it trusts. If the certificate is not in the set, the server is not to be trusted.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are several downsides to this simple approach. Servers should be able to upgrade to stronger keys over time (\\\"key rotation\\\"), which replaces the public key in the certificate with a new one. Unfortunately, now the client app has to be updated due to what is essentially a server configuration change. This is especially problematic if the server is not under the app developer's control, for example if it is a third party web service. This approach also has issues if the app has to talk to arbitrary servers such as a web browser or email app.\", \"narrative5\": \"The Android system shows an on-screen keyboard known as a soft input method when a text field in your UI receives focus.
