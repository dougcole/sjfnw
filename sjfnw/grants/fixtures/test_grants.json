As part of the handshake between an SSL client and server, the server proves it has the private key by signing its certificate with public-key cryptography.\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, anyone can generate their own certificate and private key, so a simple handshake doesn't prove anything about the server other than that the server knows the private key that matches the public key of the certificate. One way to solve this problem is to have the client have a set of one or more certificates it trusts. If the certificate is not in the set, the server is not to be trusted.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are several downsides to this simple approach. Servers should be able to upgrade to stronger keys over time (\\\"key rotation\\\"), which replaces the public key in the certificate with a new one. Unfortunately, now the client app has to be updated due to what is essentially a server configuration change. This is especially problematic if the server is not under the app developer's control, for example if it is a third party web service.
