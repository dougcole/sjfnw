I was clear they might not get past the pre-screening phase. If they do, I suggested he also apply for the MT grant.",

I\u2019m curious to know more about this - are there more programs or more successful programs reaching out to gay men in the latino community?  What accounts for this odd breakdown? Also: I am incredibly impressed with this application, but at the end of it, I found myself wondering about the relevance of the organizational scope with immigration reform and LGBTQ in the latino community. I agree whole-heartedly that with immigration reform and LGBTQ issues, it\u2019s intersectional.  I just didn\u2019t see a strong link be made by Entre Hermanos in the application.  Maybe I\u2019m over thinking this.. Maybe that an LGBTQ organization doing work outside of the sphere of the queer world is intersectional.

The Youth and Young Adult Strategic Initiative is happening, and other social justice organizations like Mockingbird Society have made it a point to be at every CEH YYA meeting with youth voices in the forefront of their minds, including creating a program with youth representatives at every step of the process 2.) The survey assessment about queer youth accessing agencies - and how agencies didn't fill out the survey or refused to take it.  I think this is a teachable moment for many agencies, and the reason why they didn't respond may be to lack of awareness, but was translated as another example of institutional oppression.  **ALSO: It may not be useful for me to be in the room when deciding on this agency.  I have ideological and professional differences with how this agency has worked in the past, and I feel I'm unable to reconcile this and decide more \"objectively\".**  Lastly, question their soundness, in the fall they had some very scary financial issues.

Personal bias: want to fund organizations that are tackling a larger segment of CJ, and though incarcerated mothers is clearly a group that needs support, personally want to fund the larger group.  Their second goal states there is a goal to \"create a policy initiative or directive that comes from the women themselves\".  I want this part to be more specific (though obviously that takes the program starting); it is included in the timeline though.  Really like the idea but I want know concretely how much will be done - how many leadership series, trainings, how much time will be spent on the policy initiative - with only $10k in funding and 23 volunteers, how much impact will be had?  Not saying that it won't be powerful, but want to know their prediction.  Collaborating with the right groups, but in what capacity?",

( she does not speak English her self and used a volunteer and google translate to finish the application.)\r\n\r\nI was not at the screening meeting so asked Kylie for feedback- I started with how our process works, how NGGP gets a large pool of applicants, they should apply to earlier cycles to get exposure. Kylie mentioned that their challenge  with the group was that other Oregon, PCUn  Capaces organizations were already screened , the group felt that by funding one they were funding others indirectly.\r\n\r\nWith out saying this to Alejandra, she said that they are part of the CAPACES network but they do not receive support from capaces for funding or grant writing. While capaces helps with exposure, each organization is responsible to find funding resources for their own programs. \r\n\r\nI invited her to apply again, and be very specific on their relationship with the Capaces network and PCUN so we learn more and members understand that too.\r\n\r\nVoz might apply for IRGP summer but will be calling for feedback before hand.-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

    "notes": "On August 15, I spoke with Nancy on the phone after she had indicated that she would like feedback about her application submitted to the General Grant for 2013. Mijo had previously acknowledged to me via email that Catalyst for Kids had applied several times, been rejected several times and that it was becoming difficult to say why their application was not even getting a site visit. It was becoming difficult to coach them, given all the rejection. When I spoke to Nancy, her sense of rejection and frustration was apparent--although she was 100% professional and cordial. \r\n\r\nWhat I told her: I emphasized the need to think about the audience for these applications. Its a general audience in many respects, volunteer and coming from many, many backgrounds and experiences. We cannot assume that people AGREE that children are better off with their biological family... although we might make the case that biological families can be made healthy for children and when we do, biological families may be best. I emphasized that idea that people reading the application may read from the experience of being forced to stay with biological family that abused them, or family that they simply did not like or get along with. I told her that the stories about people (esp. women) who have transformed their lives in order to be good parents are extremely compelling. These stories are available on the website but not in the application. I suggested that these stories be woven into applications in a way that humanizes the work and is integrated with their victories around policy work which they already describe very well.\r\n\r\nHer response: the feedback seemed to hit her in a bittersweet way. She was happy that there was a need to tell a more human story, but also hurt that it has been difficult to get their message across. She said that she had almost cried when I left her a voice message saying that staff does appreciate the work and we needed to set up a time to talk. She had become reluctant to talk with us about it, but is now feeling much more positive. I would not have known how to approach this call or conversation without talking to Mijo first.\r\n",

Mira is relatively new as paid staff and I first met her when she and an IMIrJ Board Member / volunteer came to an SJF happy hour back in March 2013. The purpose of our August 13 phone call was to talk about the General Grant application and for me to offer feedback. Mira also indicated that they may consider applying for the 2nd round of Immigration Reform later this fall. They missed the 1st round (in part because she had not yet been hired).\r\n\r\nWhat I said: I told Mira that the competition is very fierce in the General Grant and their application has the disadvantage of coming across as advocacy from an ally group rather than from those most impacted by the issue(s). I emphasized the need to define who they are as a community (and spend some time thinking about who they are as a community, if necessary) and then talk about their work from the perspective of how they are impacted / what they bring to the work based on who they are. I talked about how as a community of faith and one that has a fairly long history locally of working in solidarity with struggles of the people of Central and South America, they may have something unique or important to bring to the struggle, but they need to think about what that is.\r\n\r\nI also asked about the \"Interfaith\" in their name. I said that if they are truly \"Interfaith\" in a spectrum that goes beyond Christian that this is something that will help their presentation if its real and they bring that out. ",

The Congresswoman who is helping them is clearly going to help them move to the next level. She offered the history of how the tribe(s) were terminated and how they hope to bring them back. The issues of identity were profound and showed how individual's lives are impacted by not being able to share who they know they are.\r\n\r\nRobin - not just an issue of identity but an issue of genocide - Indigenous struggle takes different forms, such as the totem journey that happened recently in our area - giving people a voice is social justice\r\n\r\nEmiko - their application wasn't detailed; it shared that they are working for federal recognition. But the site visit really brought out how much community work they are doing. Talking to them made a huge different. Their next steps after recognition include examining what has worked and not worked for other tribes. Need social service programs.\r\n\r\nCesia - the grantwriter for the tribe(s) found SJF just by doing a search online.

I encouraged her to apply again in 2014 and suggested that she review all RFPs from SJF and submit thoughtful applications for each one that seems relevant to their work. She asked about CJ and LGBTQ as examples and I said, absolutely. She asked what was it that the funded groups had that MA didn't and I said that in 3 out of 4 grants awarded by PDX-GP, the groups presented extremely solid and exciting social justice work at the same time that they clearly struggled with access to resources and were generally underfunded.

    "notes": "Rachel is on staff at PAALF and also good friends (could be a cousin, I believe) with Shoshanna Holman who participated in the 2013 PDXGP. Shoshanna attended a SJF Happy Hour where KT and DR encouraged her to connect with Rachel and have Rachel connect with us to give feedback on their 2013 application. Here's an outline of what we discussed:\r\n\r\nThe General Grant is highly competitive - applying for more than one grant per year is a good strategy, especially when your application is strong and relevant to more than one issue area that we focus on during that year.\r\n\r\nRemember who your audience is - GP participants are decision-makers at SJF and they are also regular folks who are, or are becoming politicized, but don't necessarily know what you mean when you present your analysis unless you articulate it for a general audience. Even when they DO know what you mean, they may want to read in your application the clear presentation of your analysis / your political analysis, so that they know that YOU know what you're talking about.\r\n\r\nThe application narrative overall is strong - I shared with Rachel comments from the notes here in Project Central. \r\n\r\nUnder budget - if your salaries are over the median, make the case for why your PAALF staff are valuable like that. GP participants can be resentful of raising money for high salaries UNLESS they see the value in that person/position. With PAALF they probably would understand the value-- the PAALF team is very experienced and skilled. Sharing that information will present a stronger application.\r\n\r\nUnder the diversity chart - membership numbers are clearly rounded; I suggested using the word estimate next to rounded numbers. Rachel explained that the Board Members (125) includes sub-committee members and since PAALF has a unique structure, she wasn't sure how to translate that into \"Board Members.\" I told her that the unique structure of PAALF could play in her favor, IF she articulates it as the asset that it is. And indicates that there is some intention to that unique structure. \r\n\r\nOnce you are in a competitive pool of applicants, people are looking for excuses to cut your application, even if its a good one. People may have assumed that you have strong access to funding and didn't need an SJF grant.\r\n\r\nI encouraged Rachel to contact KT, and ML as she is preparing her application this year and as questions arise. It sounds like they may apply for the Economic Justice Grant and have already been thinking about that course of action.",

    "notes": "DR - upon their request - spoke with two staff members of Intermountain Fair Housing Council to clarify what response their application had gotten last year and how they might improve an application this year. We began with a quick review of \"the audience\" (GP participants read and decide - the are lay people, essentially volunteers, but trained in Social Justice concepts). I clued them in about the competitive nature of the General grant and suggested that they consider applying for any grant / as many grants as their work is relevant to within a single year.\r\n\r\nWhen I shared the feedback from last year, they seemed mildly frustrated and emphasized that their sincerity and integrity in community organizing is real. They genuinely value the organizing approach to addressing root causes and believe in the necessity of it. They acknowledged that their budget may seem large, but they indicated that most of the funds they receive are earmarked and must go toward services which they feel keeps them locked in a service model when they would really like to challenge that approach through organizing. They shared several examples of how critical their work has been for a variety of groups marginalized in the Idaho social landscape. They described how powerful their organizer (underpaid as they are) has been in helping connect families to support, knowing their rights, and a sense of belonging. They believe they are combating racism, xenophobia, and a variety of forms of discrimination, and having an impact. They described their key leaders doing this work as very diverse team. ",

Why do you think they listed you?\r\nMIC has reached out to us in the past, Casey has been dilligent about getting a hold of us to see if we'd like to be a part of their new program. Anthony started to attend the meetings after Thomas left, but Anthony became overwhelmed and couldn't put in the time. Missoula Indian Center does work with Native folks in Missoula and MIC wants to do the same. Missoula Indian Center is just a small org and is very limited on staff. Would like to be involved, because they are doing good things, but don't have capacity to be directly involved. Could see us getting involved someday.\r\n\r\n2. How do you think they act as allies to communities of color?\r\nTrying to open the door to Native clients from Missoula Indian Center to get involved. MIC sought out homeless population in MIssoula to get involved, regardless of race (lots of native folks who are homeless in Missoula). Casey wants to build the relationship so Native people feel comfortable getting involved.\r\n\r\nProgram they are starting is about religion, but they wanted to involve more than just 'religion.' So they reached out to us to let us know they were inviting all spirituality to their work and wanted to broaden the conversation.",
