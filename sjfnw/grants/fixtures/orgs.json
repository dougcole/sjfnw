    "mission": "Idaho Safe Schools Coalition (the Coalition), is a grassroots partnership of youth, parents, educators and community members dedicated to ensuring that each child feels safe attending school.Our mission is to help Idaho schools become safer places where every family can belong, where every educator can teach, and where every child can learn, regardless of sexual orientation or gender identity. The goals of the Coalition are to help schools decrease and respond to incidences of harassment and victimization and to better meet the needs of students who are perceived and/or identify as LGBTQQ (queer), as well as children of queer families. In order to achieve our goals, we focus on systemic change and programing that can transform Idaho schools toward becoming safer places where every family can belong, where every educator can teach, and where every child can learn, regardless of sexual orientation or gender identity. \r\n\r\n\t\r\n",

We believe that the incarceration of women, and further, the separation of incarcerated mothers from their children due to incarceration, is a form of violence and reproductive oppression. We envision a day in which women of every color, ability, class and sexual orientation are able to help shape the policies that affect them and their families.  In such a world, the rights of incarcerated and formerly incarcerated women as persons and mothers would not only be respected but also supported. ",
