We believe that because of the possibility of Comprehensive Immigration Reform that could lead to a path to citizenship, this year offers a historic opportunity for immigrant organizations and movements to build up their leadership and capacity for powerful community organizing. And we believe strong community organizing will lead to greater systemic change, including immigration reform as defined and prioritized by the communities themselves. Therefore, we are open to funding organizations that are taking a variety of positions for and against the CIR bill(s), or no position at all. Our priority is to help organizations use this historic moment to build stronger community organizing. \r\n\r\nHas your organization taken a position on the immigration reform bill(s) currently being considered in Congress? Are you... \r\na) endorsing it, \r\nb) opposing it, \r\nc) in the process of developing a position, \r\nd) taking no position, or\r\ne) other? \r\nPlease explain.\r\n\r\nHow are you using the current momentum around immigration reform to build up your own organization and movement?
