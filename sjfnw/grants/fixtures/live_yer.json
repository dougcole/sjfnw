      "goal_progress": "Powder River continued to focus on activities that are priorities for members and that can be implemented effectively at the state and local levels.  Members also participated in national campaigns with coalition partners. Powder River was most effective at the state level as relayed below and members helped keep the issues in the national spotlight. Members testified numerous times before the State Oil and Gas Commission, they traveled to Denver to meet with the EPA and to DC to meet with administrators and elected officials.  Powder River was successful to some degree in several of our objectives. The official State responses are not always in direct reaction to our activities; however the Governor is often using Powder River terminology and talking almost verbatim from our communications. The Oil and Gas Commission agenda has been largely driven by Powder River over the last year with the Seven Point Plan for Groundwater published, the Powder River people\u2019s petition filed concerning restricting flaring, increasing setbacks and more enforcement, and the continued media coverage of the negative aspects of the current oil boom. Our initiatives have been taken up by the Commission and the inability of the Commission Director to implement the changes resulted in his forced resignation. Powder River continues to be recognized by the government and the press as the people\u2019s representative and lead organization when protecting citizen\u2019s rights concerning oil and gas development. Some significant wins for Powder River:\r\n\u2022\tPowder Rivers Supreme Court case on fracking - the Wyoming Supreme Court found a lower court had ruled in error regarding disclosure of the chemicals used in hydraulic fracturing or fracking.\r\n\u2022\tWyoming Oil and Gas Commission is taking up rulemaking on setbacks in response to our filed petition.\r\n\u2022\tWyoming Oil and Gas Commission has refused flaring requests, companies must show long term plans for alternative uses of gas besides flaring, and the number of requests and approvals of flaring have been greatly reduced. The Commission has committed to taking up flaring in a later rulemaking.\r\n\u2022\tThe EPA very clearly stated to the Wyoming Oil and Gas Commission that a deep disposal well in the Madison Aquifer for oil field waste cannot be formally approved until it is formally submitted to EPA and they have given their final approval.\r\n\u2022\tA detailed plan by the State for increased plugging and reclamation of abandoned wells was adopted, funded and is being implemented.\r\nPowder River submitted 31 pages of comments to the BLM on the Buffalo Field Office Draft Resource Management Plan (RMP) with another five pages of scientific references on 9/25/2013. Our organization reviewed the entire document and corresponding exhibits, maps, appendices, and supporting information (such as the reasonably foreseeable development scenario (\u201cRFD\u201d), and after a careful review, we were very concerned about a number of new programmatic changes from the existing RMP and current management strategies for the planning area, including first and foremost a rollback of current protections for areas with steep slopes and poor reclamation potential. We were also highly disappointed with the cursory level of analysis given to major impact areas, such as groundwater drawdown and air quality, and are disappointed with the number of inaccurate and outdated assumptions and data included in the EIS. These and other issues were highlighted in our comments to the BLM.\r\n\r\nBecause of Powder River\u2019s strong push to address the many water problems that occur in unconventional oil and gas development, as stated in our published document A Seven Point Plan to Protect Groundwater, the state went into rulemaking for baseline water testing. Powder River advocated for a state requirement that an identifying tracer or marker be required to be injected with each drilling and fracking job that will fingerprint that facility with follow up monitoring of nearby water sources. The proposal was rejected by the Wyoming Oil and Gas Conservation Commission and is not in the final rule. Overall, the rule is a \u201csham\u201d that requires less testing and monitoring than industry has been doing voluntarily.\r\nWith more oil being shipped by rail through Wyoming and accidents taking place in other places because of this type of shipment, Powder River moved to help some citizens address the situation in their town. We provided research assistance and organizing support to members and citizens in the community of Fort Laramie concerning a proposed Oil Rail Transport facility right on the border of the town and a few hundred yards from the Platte River and the historic Fort Laramie. Unfortunately the loadout facility was completed.\r\n ",

      "achieved": "This year, Oregon won marriage equality through the courts. Originally, Oregon was gearing up to put forth a ballot measure to achieve marriage equality through the Oregon United for Marriage Campaign, which Causa was a part of. Thanks to the leadership of organizations like Basic Rights Oregon and Oregon ACLU, we were able to achieve a  solid victory without having to spend more money on a ballot measure campaign. This victory was achieved through the years of work that Causa\u2019s partner organizations executed to build public and institutional support for marriage equality in Oregon. Although we cannot claim that we directly helped make this victory happen, Causa was prepared to move forward with the Oregon United for Marriage campaign to organize and educate our base of Latino immigrants around this issue. This took years of laying the ground work by educating our base about the intersections of being an immigrant and LGBTQ, telling stories of individuals who are LGBTQ and immigrant, committing as an organization to intentionally organize LGBTQ Latino immigrants around issues that impact them, and developing a program that is aimed to increase support of LGBTQ issues within the general Latino immigrant community. ",
      "goal_progress": "\r\nGoal 1: Expand our LGBTQ Radio Initiative: La Voz de Todos to reach Central Oregon, a predominately conservative, rural region of our state where there are limited resources for the LGBTQ Latino immigrant community.\r\n\r\nProgress: \r\n\u2022\tWe purchased all the equipment needed to record our radio show from different locations. \r\n\u2022\tWe created a website to upload the podcasts, allowing us to reach across the state and nationally to people who have access to the internet. http://causaoregon.org/LaVozDeTodos/. The radio show is now broadcasted online and through Radio Movimiento community radio in Woodburn, Oregon. Attached is an mp3 recording of one of the shows. \r\n\u2022\tWe initiated conversations with rural community radio stations to send them our shows for them to play them locally. They have expressed interest, and the next step is to set them up with our podcasts to play from their local station. \r\n\r\nChallenges: \r\n\u2022\tWe had a delay trying to find knowledgeable people to help us with the operation of the equipment. Training on how to use the equipment took much more time than anticipated. This in turn delayed our ability to get rural radio stations to use our content.\r\n\r\nGoal 2: Raise awareness about LGBTQ issues within the Latino immigrant community in Central Oregon.\r\n\r\nProgress: \r\n\u2022\tWe engaged 12 LGBTQ volunteers in producing the radio shows.\r\n\u2022\tCausa participated in Bend\u2019s Pride event to raise awareness about our LGBTQ program, share resources, and recruit new local participants in our activities. \r\n\r\nGoal 3: Deepen our organizing efforts in Central Oregon to include the LGBTQ community and strengthen our collective power to ensure Representative Greg Walden of Oregon\u2019s 2nd District votes in favor of immigration reform.\r\n\r\nProgress: \r\n\u2022\tCausa staff and volunteers were on Bend\u2019s local radio station KPOV once/month to give an update about immigration reform and call people to action by promoting upcoming immigration reform actions in Central Oregon and to call Rep. Walden\u2019s office. \r\n\u2022\tCausa\u2019s staff and volunteers organized 5 immigration reform actions in Walden\u2019s district. This included a 50-mile march from Madras to Bend, including members of 7 organizations that walked with Causa (Rural Organizing Project, Basic Rights Oregon, AFL-CIO, Immigrant Law Group, Recursos, Central Oregon Jobs with Justice, Oregon Dreamers). We held several office sit-ins, office visits, and hosted a stop of the national Fast for Families Bus Tour that called on Congress and the President to take action. \r\n\r\nChallenges\r\n\u2022\tUnfortunately Rep. Walden did not support an immigration reform bill effort in the House, even though he expressed to Causa leaders that he believes the system is broken. Instead, he chose to support a bill that would revoke the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program that provides temporary relief from deportation, a driver license, and work permit to undocumented young people. We still have much to do to move Rep. Walden on immigration reform. \r\n\r\n",

      "achieved": "As mentioned above, in spite of attempts to make Medicaid expansion just go away, the Legislature finally included a note in the state\u2019s budget directing the Governor and the Department of Health to negotiate with the Federal Government on a plan to extend Medicaid to adults without children. We are continuing to monitor the progress of these negotiations, which are thus far not very transparent.\r\n\r\nIn addition, we successfully fought passage of two sales tax exemption measures favoring industry and convinced the Joint Revenue Committee to formulate a better system of evaluating proposed tax exemptions and measuring their effectiveness.\r\n\r\nDuring the legislative session this year, tensions around a dispute over the boundaries of the Wind River Reservation surfaced, raising anti-Native American feelings. We successfully opposed a measure that would have required state agencies to use maps defining a diminished reservation. Then, in May, when a Wisconsin based anti-native hate group ( Citizen Equal Rights Alliance) made plans to stage a \u201cregional conference\u201d in Riverton surfaced, we were able to assist with response and accessed legal experts to produce a report explaining in simple language the processes behind the boundary decision and its potential effects on both tribal and non-tribal residents of the affected area. We also sent out email alerts to our list asking people to contact public officials who attended a private meeting with CERA to come clean about what happened in that meeting and what they took away from it. CERA has since disappeared from Wyoming but the state\u2019s appeal of the EPA ruling remains before the 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.\r\n\r\nFor its interim work, the Legislature also took up Medicaid expansion on the reservation, an investigation of the state\u2019s new workplace safety grant program that the ESPC has supported, restoration of voting rights for felons, and digital information privacy (an effort to protect workers\u2019 social media, financial, and other personal digital information from employers). The Legislature has also directed the Select Committee on Tribal Relations to \u201cwork to facilitate and foster communication and strong working relationships among State, Tribal and local entities\u2026\u201d\r\n\r\nThe State is planning a $250 million renovation of the state Capitol. At ESPC urging, the state will study equipping committee rooms for video streaming and installing electronic voting system components. A select committee also will review public comment procedures to enhance \u201copen and transparent operations of the Legislature.\u201d\r\n\r\nOne victory was less apparent. For the first time in many sessions, no legislation was offered to officially bar same-sex marriage in Wyoming.\r\n\r\nOur advocacy for a stronger federal silica standard and efforts to communicate the dangers of silica exposure during hydraulic fracturing operations prompted Wyoming OSHA to write training standards into new state Oil & Gas industry safety rules. WY OSHA also sent letters to thousands of Wyoming employers warning them of potential health hazards related to silica.\r\n\r\nIn the 2014 election campaigns, gubernatorial candidates have taken up worker safety as an issue, demonstrating the value of our long-term efforts.\r\n",
      "goal_progress": "Our overall goal for this grant was to work towards more equitable public policies around our core issues of tax policy, worker safety/rights, and civic engagement. We did this through educating the public through media and online communication, empowering and mobilizing our supporters to speak out on these issues, and pressuring policymakers on specific solutions. \r\n\r\nWe accomplished much in these areas over the last year. We worked on our own and in coalition on Medicaid expansion to raise awareness about this important issue. One supporter wrote of an alert we sent out that we had one of the best explanations of the need for expansion he\u2019d read. And the Legislature heard from supporters, as well. Representative Lee Filer told Wyoming Public Radio that \u201cI hear more people wanting Medicaid expansion than opposing it. I\u2019ll bet yesterday I had over 90 emails from people all over the state saying please expand Medicaid, please expand Medicaid, and they give reasons why and so emails are pretty lengthy and tell the whole story about a life and why it would help them, but I haven\u2019t heard much opposition.\u201d\r\n\r\nIn spite of many attempts to kill any kind of expansion, in the end, the Legislature included a note in the state\u2019s budget directing the Governor and the Department of Health to negotiate with the Federal Government on a plan to extend Medicaid to adults without children. We are continuing to monitor the progress of these negotiations, which are thus far not very transparent.\r\n\r\nWe held a very successful Workers Memorial Day commemoration on April 28. In addition to a great turnout in Cheyenne, we released Preventable Deaths, our first comprehensive report on worker safety in Wyoming. The report highlights the devastating effects of workplace deaths on Wyoming families, and includes the story of Ed Simmons, whose son Anthony was killed when he fell while working at a Casper home-building plant just over a year ago. Go to our web site to see the full report. The report also examines state efforts to improve job safety in the state, and recommends a long list of steps that industry and the state can take to prevent future deaths and injuries and to avoid long-term health hazards.\r\n\r\nWind River Reservation activists staged successful MLK/Equality Day events in Riverton and attended our Citizen Lobbyist Training workshops on the reservation and in Cheyenne. With the assistance of ESPC member agency the Wyoming Association of Churches, they brought their expertise to the ESPC Board meeting in Riverton on April 15, when they conducted a panel on their civil rights activities and planned election-year activities.\r\n\r\nLast summer, we conducted both a job safety training workshop and an immigration rights seminar in Gillette, and a minimum wage workshop in Riverton. We continued this outreach with a Know Your Rights workshop in Rock Springs in January and minimum wage and other workshops at our Citizen Lobbyist Training in Cheyenne in February. \r\n\r\nOur Citizen Lobbyist Training this year attracted 39 participants. We had workshops on minimum wage, Medicaid expansion, and other topics the legislature was considering, including a Budget 101 workshop (this was the biennial Budget Session).\r\n\r\nSince the Legislature adjourned in March, we\u2019ve been tracking legislation on digital privacy, restoring felon voting rights, and tax issues. At ESPC\u2019s request, the Legislature\u2019s Digital Privacy Task Force heard expert testimony from Lewis Maltby, President of the National Workrights Institute in July. Lew has been a leader in employment privacy for over 25 years and has testified before Congress numerous times on this issue. We\u2019ve also been keep track of, and attending committee hearings on, restoring felon voting rights. We\u2019re happy to report that Wyoming seems poised to enact legislation that will make restoration of rights automatic upon completion of a citizen\u2019s sentence, including probation or parole, for nonviolent felons. \r\n\r\nIn April, ESPC\u2019s Executive Director Dan Neal gave testimony to the U.S. Department of Labor on OSHA's proposed silica dust rules. He attended as part of a delegation from NCOSH, the National Coalition for Occupational Safety and Health, representing the ESPC and WYCOSH (Wyoming Coalition for Occupational Safety and Health), an NCOSH affiliate chapter. This impacts Wyoming workers, including those in the oil and gas industry who are exposed to silica dust as a result of fracking.\r\n\r\n",

We are hopeful that we will have passed a Billings NDO by the beginning of fall, although there is still quite a bit of organizing to do to ensure passage.  If we are able to pass an NDO in Billings, we will have achieved a critical benchmark by having five major cities pass NDOs and offering protection from discrimination to over 28% of Montana residents (who live in covered areas) in addition to the thousands of Montanans who visit these cities for work, family, and recreation.  With over a quarter of the state\u2019s population protected from discrimination in politically diverse areas, we will be well positioned to move our work to state-wide scale in advance of the 2015 Montana Legislative Session.  The community building work that has kept our base informed and engaged will be vital in moving toward state-wide legal changes that offer uniform protections to all LGBT people no matter where they live, work, or visit in Montana.  \r\nIn addition to our work on LGBT organizing and policy advocacy, we were deeply engaged in a coalition effort to educate and mobilize Montanans around expanding Medicaid for over 70,000 poor Montanans.  While we have not achieved our policy goal yet, we have built an incredible base of over 300 volunteers, and IDed over 25,000 voters on the issue through a petition drive.  We were unable to gather enough signatures to place the issue on the November 2014 ballot, however we increased visibility and knowledge, developed leadership, and are in a stronger position to pass Medicaid expansion during the 2015 Montana Legislative Session, as well as to drive the vote around this issue in the fall.  \r\n",
      "goal_progress": "As we look back on the goals of our project, we have made good progress in terms of creating spaces for community members to come together, engage in organizing opportunities, and generally updating participants on LGBT work across the state.   However we did have a delay in our plans due to the collapse of the state-wide organization that has traditionally organized, funded, and put on the Montana Pride Festival.  The collapse of this organization would have led to the cancellation of the annual Pride Festival that traditionally travels to different cities in the state to build understanding of and strength within the LGBT community.  The festival was to be held in Butte this year in June for the second year (each city hosts for two years).  It was an unfortunate situation because Butte had recently passed a nondiscrimination ordinance which the Pride Festival the prior year had sparked the idea and organizing through which it was accomplished.  Helena-based LGBT leaders almost immediately stepped up to plan, organize, and execute a low-cost, but high visibility Pride Festival.  This meant that focus for several months (February through June) moved away from local events and activities here in Helena and toward planning the Pride Festival in Butte.  Helena leaders showed incredible initiative and commitment in making sure that Butte\u2019s policy success with the NDO was recognized and celebrated.  The Network provided financial and administrative support to the effort, but it was driven entirely by volunteer leaders who stepped up and pulled it off, making the programming and the celebration a huge success.  The festival included a speech by Governor Steve Bullock (the first time that a Governor in Montana had formally attended or spoken at a Pride Festival).  This delay essentially set us back a quarter, but we have events planned for the fall which will feed into issue education and voter mobilization through the general election and into legislative planning for 2015.

It is an organization that is independent of the Network (or any other organization), entirely volunteer driven, and very impressive.  The Network plans to continue working with Big Sky Pride to aid them administratively, financially, and by offering issue education and mobilization to their incredible work.  This was not a specific goal of our project because we didn\u2019t know when if or when it would be achievable, but it is an exciting outcome for the long-term sustainability of the community building work that is so vital to issue organizing and building collective power to win positive policy outcomes in Montana.

      "summarize_last_year": "Since receiving our grant from the Giving Project, the Network has continued to engage LGBT community members in a variety of ways that build community and deepen the knowledge of policy issues facing the community at the local, state, and federal levels.  The Network had one on one meetings with leaders who were developed over the course of a difficult Nondiscrimination Ordinance (NDO) campaign to assess what leaders felt would be the best strategies toward continuing to build and engage the LGBT community in Helena.  Ideas ranged from continuing social events like happy hours, potlucks, dances, and parties.  In addition to these ideas, special film screenings and service projects rose to the top.  So far this year, we have engaged in one service project, one film screening, sponsored and aided in promotion and planning of a dance and celebration to commemorate the signing of a bill to remove unconstitutional language from Montana statute that criminalized same-sex sexual conduct, and sponsored and aided administratively with the state-wide Montana Pride celebration.  Investment in community building has truly helped to sustain key leadership that was developed during the Helena campaign through three campaigns that weren\u2019t locally focused.  These leaders have taken on initiative and done an amazing job developing and executing events that are fun, focused, and informative for LGBT community members and our allies.  ",

We hosted a screening of Brother Outsider to a packed room and were able to have some incredible speakers including the Executive Director of the Urban League and Walter Naegle, Bayard Rustin's surviving partner.   The official Portland Black Pride celebration included six events over days and raised more money then any other year we have been organizing it.\r\n\r\nOur Data collection work with Multnomah County has led to a resolution and internal changes improving data collection practices with all Multnomah County Employees.  Next steps are to expand beyond employees and include all residents. \r\n\r\nThe process for implementing a new database is a heavy lift and includes involvement from all three chapters.  We have selected salesforce as our new database and held meetings to finalize the initial format as well as discuss needs and uses.  Current plans include beginning use and implementation by September, with survey collection in the Fall.  Our newly hired intern has begun working on expanding our volunteer base.\r\n\r\nWe hosted three faith luncheons in the past year and also meet one on one with the faith leaders we are engaging as we support them on their journey.  A lead volunteer is excited to help lead these efforts and has already began engaging with other faith leaders. We are currently engaging with nearly two dozen African American faith leaders who all have shifted and/or supported others in shifting their support for LGBTQ communities and individuals.  With my personality lending towards more progress at a faster rate I am continually reminded by my faith outreach planning committee, half of which are faith leaders, to practice patience and remember that this is a journey. \r\n\r\nWe raised over $2000 for AIDS Walk 2013, our most raised yet. \r\n\r\nOur 5 Year Anniversary was an incredible event as mentioned above that attendees are still commenting on.  We raised over $4,000, but weighing the cost of the event we have questions to consider moving forward.  We need to either significantly lower the cost of the event or more double the amount of funds raised.\r\n \r\nA large part of capacity was working on the Oregon United for Marriage campaign.  Oregon legalized same sex marriage through the courts in May of 2014.  We have had some impact on swaying and influencing that court decision through our work, but we most definitely had a huge impact in influencing the campaign, lifting up our community, building support and shifting the conversation within the African American community.\r\n\r\nPortland Black Pride 2014 was our most successful year to date as shared above and we hope to continue to build off of this amazing annual celebration as well as continue to include year round events for our base.

      "summarize_last_year": "It has been a very full and exciting year.  Hopefully, we can limit our sharing to the highlights while still giving you a full picture of what this last year has looked like. \r\n\r\nYouth Outreach: We have moved forward with our joint Youth programming in partnership with Portland Parks and Recreation, expanded our high school GSA support program to include services to middle and elementary schools, developed a leadership pipeline within our organization and taken on an intern in line with that.  In addition to the weekly QCrew programming we co-coordinated our 2nd Annual Queer Youth Pool Party providing a day of fun and joy as well as much needed space for Queer youth enjoy the park safely. Some of our leadership development efforts has been to work with our partners in providing placement opportunities in leadership and development programs like the African American Leadership Academy, and the Community Health Workers Training; as well as supporting our members and base in attending trainings and conferences like Activists Mobilizing Power.\r\n\r\nThis year the marriage equality and religious discrimination campaigns came to OR and we played a large role including joining the communities of color coalition table and leading as an anchor for the African American community.  We lifted up racial justice values within the campaign, leveraged our relationships to talk with leaders and partners and secure pledges and endorsements, raised the visibility of LGB African American couples and their stories and provided culturally specific and relevant trainings to families, supporters, and volunteers.  \r\n\r\nComing out of our 2012 Lift Every Voice report with the Urban League of Portland we joined other organizations and leaders in their advisory group for the 2014 State of Black Oregon Report to ensure that LGBTQ communities will be included in the report.  Some of our work has been to convene an LGBTQ focus group, identify families and youth to add personal narratives, and recruit individuals to an LGBT elders focus group to further inform the report. \r\n\r\nOur work to improve data collection practices and outcomes has ebbed and flowed.  Our initial focus area has been Multnomah County, the largest county in Oregon and the base of our chapter.  We have briefed several county officials on the importance and need for i,proving data collection around sexual orientation and gender identity and advised next steps for a resolution and roll out with Multnomah County employees. Progress was stalled during county chair transitions and elections.  We have met with the new chair and began planning for a county wide data collection policy. \r\n\r\nOur role as an advocacy organization also includes holding establishments and organizations accountable to our community and our needs and working with them to make meaningful changes; like our involvement with the Q Center (http://bit.ly/1pCm2Fs) and Portland State University (http://bit.ly/1sg1TVZ).  \r\n\r\nA large part of work has continued to focus on educating and training students, adults, teachers, counselors, organizers and more on a range of topics centered around intentionally lifting up LGBTQ African Americans.  Some of these trainings have included a Diversity Training for PFLAG Chapters around the country, a racial justice training for Oregon PFLAG Chapters, Portland Public Schools panel and workshop, bi-annual panel with students of color joining the teaching profession, and the Oregon Students Of Color Conference, just to name a few. \r\n\r\nOur Faith work has continued to progress and teach us patience, reminding us that we are all on our journey.  We have hosted three luncheons in the past year with over 15 African American faith leaders, all of whom support LGBT families, some of which support marriage equality.  Our next steps are inviting more to the table and supporting all to be public in their support.  One of the faith leaders from our faith outreach work gave the invocation at our 5 year anniversary celebration which was very inspiring.  This summer we worked one of the churches to host Rainbow Sunday, and to honor and celebrate LGBTQ families, couples, and individuals.\r\n\r\nOur 5 year anniversary was a huge success in bringing the community out to share in our work, and celebrate each other.  Our anniversary celebration continues to grow with this year hosting nearly 200 attendees.  Our other events this year included our very special Annual Brunch, and Family Feast.  One major highlight this year was Portland Black Pride!  We hosted seven events in five days!  This was our best year yet and it was truly felt by all involved.  On a low note, our Portland Black Pride facebook page, a main source for communicating about Portland Black Pride, has switched from a friend page to a like page, deleting our pictures, diminishing our presence, and making it very challenge to engage with that base.  Still, we have seen great strides in communication and earned media with articles in several outlets including the Oregonian, PQ Monthly, Street Roots, The Skanner, The Portland Observer, Elixher, and Beautiful Black Portland. \r\n\r\nInternally we have made some significant changes, for example, we formalized our steering committee at a visioning and planning retreat in December, and are in the process of implementing a salesforce database. \r\n\r\nAt the root of who we are is support, whether supporting the empowerment and growth of others like Queer Intersections or the new formation of an LGBTQ group for residents in low income, low resourced North Portland; or supporting our community by adding our voices to the conversation for Cover Oregon, and the 50th Anniversary of the March on Washington Celebration; or supporting each other, not only with our monthly socials to provide space for learning, support, healing, ans sharing, or the many safe spaces we create throughout the year, some of which are shared above, but by celebrating each other like free photo shoot offered to our members, or the Holiday Help drive where families helped other families. \r\n\r\nOver the last year we have worked to strengthen our PFLAG family, hold each other just a little bit closer, and lift each other higher and higher.\r\n\r\n",

      "achieved": "ICAN was successful in winning a city ordinance in Caldwell that restricts the location of payday and title loan businesses in the city and limits their growth through special use permits.  In addition, Caldwell recently revised their sign ordinance to reduce the  numerous and over-sized signage often used by predatory loan companies. \r\n \r\nICAN educated legislators about the need to address predatory lending with an interest rate cap, and although  the rate cap legislation did not pass, a first step was made by the legislature in recognizing the need for reforms and adopting limited legislation that helps a trapped borrower with a one time payment plan that is interest free.  While we don't consider this a victory it is a benchmark that will lead us to victory.\r\n  ",
      "goal_progress": "Predatory Lending: Working with Mayor Nancolas, ICAN organized a local campaign in the city of Caldwell for a city ordinance that restricts the location and limits the growth of predatory lenders in the city.  ICAN leaders collected petitions, shared their stories for reports and the media, testified at the City Council meeting, educated their state representatives, advocated in others cities and during the legislative session, and earned significant media attention on the issue. \r\n\r\nICAN also did outreach out to surrounding communities in the Treasure Valley and pressed for a collective action by the Treasure Valley Partnership to institute similar city ordinances that will drive predatory lenders out of the Treasure Valley. The Treasure Valley partnership members participated in meetings with state elected representatives to push for a state rate cap on predatory lending in Idaho. Currently, Kuna, Middleton and Wilder have protections that require a special use permit for any payday or title loan business to open in the city. Leadership in Nampa, Garden City, Meridian, and Boise continue to work with city councils to finalize and adopt ordinances in those cities. ICAN leaders in Burley, Rupert, Paul and Heyburn educated their local city councils by attending council meetings and testifying about the cycle of debt created by predatory lending, while leaders in Moscow and Lewiston have collected petitions, stories, testified at city council and are preparing for shark week actions next week, that will continue to push for ordinances in north Idaho communities. \r\n\r\nICAN leaders have also pushed for a larger state wide campaign that gets to the heart of the predatory lending issue with a state rate cap of 36% on all loan products.  ICAN leaders met with the Department of Finance and Senator Heider early in December and agreed to payday lending reform that supported the Pew Research recommendations and a 36% rate cap. Then, while drafting the legislation, Senator Heider and the Department of Finance also met with lobbyists from the payday lending industry.  Unfortunately, the final product, while providing a way out of a loan without interest one time, did not cap the interest rate.  ICAN members were active throughout the legislative session to continue to educate state leadership about the need for a rate cap and oppose the industry backed bill. The final vote passed the law by one vote.\r\n\r\nMedicaid Expansion: ICAN continued work with the Medicaid Matters coalition in the fight to secure funding of healthcare for all Idahoans up to 138% of the poverty level. ICAN members shared their stories for our report on job creation and the economic benefit of expanding Medicaid, which was released in February. ICAN leaders in Lewiston facilitated a Healthcare Roundtable with healthcare providers, state elected leadership, and local ICAN members to discuss local and statel-level solutions for the 77,000 poor Idahoans who remain without access to healthcare. \r\n\r\nImmigration Reform: ICAN continued to support a larger campaign for fair immigration reform. With a strong desire to bring families out of the shadows and allow them compete fairly and safely in our economy, ICAN continues to fight hard for a national solution. Over the last year, ICAN was successful in continuing to build strong immigrant leadership in Idaho that has moved to the national stage to represent Idaho. While continued pressure on Idaho's congressional delegation gained consistent media attention, ICAN members also partnered with national coalitions to share in a larger movement pushing immigration reform.  ICAN has also moved to a rural strategy that includes working with local leaders in rural communities across Idaho to support principles and values that promote acceptance of immigrant families and what they bring to our economy. \r\n",

Conyers (Michigan) since 2003 at the Congress. The current version/language has a  barrier regarded to \"eligibility for Immigrants and access to Universal Health Care\". Our participation at the One Single Payer States and Health Care Now! conference in Nashville, in October 2013, was crucial to change this debate, and to demonstrate the need to change the language of this bill. We could educate 150 people, from 22 states about this problem. We also have been educating through policy and Immigration issues analysis and the reality regard to the Immigration Reform,  with our colleagues and members of the Health Care for All Oregon coalition. We are advocating for the need to meet with Rep. Conyers and other policy makers to have it changed. \r\n\r\nb) National, SB1782, for Universal Health Care, written and introduced by Sen. Bernie (Massachusetts) on Dec. 2013. The bill is a better version of HR 1200 (by Rep. Mac Dermot/Washington state) with a provision for Immigrants to have access to health care. \r\nHowever, still there is no clear understanding that undocumented people are included. We are educating and developing analysis with Health Care for All Oregon coalition members about the need to make these bills straight forward for everyone, regardless of documentation. \r\n\r\nc) Drivers' Card bill: despite the bill was passed and signed by the Governor in Oregon, in 2013, it has was not implemented on January 2014 because a Referendum by Anti Immigrants groups. We are supporting Causa Immigrants Rights to educate and for voter registration about Yes for Safe Roads Campaign, to reestablish this bill.\r\n\r\n3) Recruitment of 2 new Board members, from the Latino communities of Gresham and Wood Village.\r\n\r\n4) We could make it official the partnership with Doula Caribe Internacional with two initial trainings for our Latina Leaders and community members as an initial step to prepare them to lead, analyze and advocate for policy changes to support women and children.\r\n\r\n5) Current policy analysis for next year: Paid Maternal leave for Working Mothers, Support for Public Breastfeeding, and Women's right to Birth (not cesareans). ",
      "goal_progress": "We have made great progress  towards our goals and implementation of strategies as planned for last year, despite of some changes, the outcomes have been great so far while preparing the terrain for next year activities.\r\n\r\n1) Colectivo MUJERES implemented with a well committed group of Latinas with the promising of a greater number to join us soon. Even though we did not reached the initial membership of 20, and could not engage Corvallis community, on the other hand among the 13 engaged, 95% are Latinas, with one very young participant!  Besides, we could outreach to Umatilla, a city located 200 miles from Portland (in the mountains), and two other places with larger concentration of immigrants, Wood Village, and Rockwood (close to Gresham).  \r\n\r\n2) For our Leadership and Advocacy activities, we could outreach, engage, and prepare 3 new local small groups from Rockwood, Gresham, and Wood Village, besides Hood River and Portland, totalizing 18 community members to participate at: The State of Equity Legislative Forum Theatre (Gresham), and at the May Day March for Immigrants (Salem); and Women's Celebration a,ong Latinas and Caucasian Allies members of the Gresham United Methodist Church. Among all, we had 7 sessions of leadership for trainings. Towards new goals we are also developing our partnership with schools around Gresham, with the promise to outreach other Latino groups especially women and young girls.\r\n\r\n3) Universal Health Care advocacy and training: this has been one of  most important, not expected, activities that we could/are combining with Immigration Reform and Driver's Card (for undocumented people).  \r\n\r\n4) Social media: facebook and twitter has been two new extra activities, since February 2014 because we realized that these are two of the best ways to outreach and be in contact with Latino communities and other groups of immigrants.\r\n\r\n5) We are creating a new Network - combined with Colectivo MUJERES - to outreach also local clinics where Latina Mothers/pregnant women seek for health care and with other local non profit organizations in Washington County  (Adelante Mujeres), and Multnomah County/Gresham (El Programa Hispano). \r\n\r\n6) we were authorized by the GUMC (the Church) to have a small space among their community garden, which we are interested for organizing purposes while providing some self-sustainable vegetables for the communities we are working in Gresham.\r\n\r\nIn short, our collective evaluation to what we could achieve is very positive and brings promising plans for next year.",

This includes continuing to move forward the End Police/ICE Collaboration! Campaign with the A.C.T. Network. This also includes moving our Divest from Private Prisons campaign forward with ENLACE. \r\n2.\tPassing of last bill ing House Bill package introduced by the Wage Theft Coalition HB 2976. \r\n3.\tPolicy reform by the City of Portland to support our efforts of increasing the impact the MLK Jr. Worker Center has in the Central Eastside Industrial District (Save the Center Campaign).\r\n4.\tIncrease number of employers who hire workers at the center through increased marketing efforts and increase number of jobs available for day laborers. \r\n5.\tIncrease day laborer retention rates in leadership development opportunities.\r\n\r\nProgress:\r\n\r\nGoal 1: Day laborers, and organizations and coalitions representing them, were generally left out of negotiation for a Comprehensive Immigration bill. The voice of day laborers were essentially left out due to a compromise between business and labor, big political players in immigration policy, which led a bill they felt would have the best opportunity to pass both chambers in Congress.  Being left out of the negotiation table essentially ensured a Comprehensive Bill out of the U.S Senate that barely addressed day laborers. Despite this short coming, and Congress' inability to pass any comprehensive measures, day labor organizations continued to escalate organizing tactics and campaigns.\r\n\r\nNationally, Voz participated in the Not One More Deportation campaign coordinated by the National Day Labor Organizing Network (NDLON), a campaign with the sole purpose of seeking executive action by the White House administration to bring relief to the 12 million undocumented immigrants, through the complete halt of deportation and expansion of Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA). The campaign hopes to see a victory as the White House Administration has noted executive action before the end of this summer.\r\n\r\nLocally in Portland, Voz has led the Act Network coalition to end the Police ICE Collaboration in Multnomah County in April of 2014. Through the pressure of the Coalition, the legal victory of county court case, and key allies in elected positions; Voz and allies were able to end Police ICE Collaboration in Multnomah County, and has since had a cascade effect in other counties in opting out of complying with ICE Holds and \"Secure Communities\", a federal program under Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).\r\n\r\nVoz campaign on Prison Divestment have successfully brought awareness to the City of Portland by setting meetings with City Commissioners in the City of Portland. Voz and allies aim to push for a resolution in 2015.\r\n\r\nGoal 2: Voz and allies were able to pass HR 2976 in the 2013 Legislative session which essentially brought more accountability to unscrupulous sub-contractors. Prior to the bill, sub-contractors had very little oversight and accountability. The bill, which become law would now require sub-contractors to register to the Bureau of Labor and Industries (BOLI), which allow them to be tracked, and face fines issued by BOLI if convicted of withholding wages from workers, especially day laborers.\r\n\r\nGoal 3: Though Voz did not receive an official policy victory to bring permanency for the MLK Worker Center from City Hall, Voz and allies from faith, business, and labor, were able to get Portland Development Commission, an agency that monitors city owned property and growth in the Portland metro area, to create a workplan to bring a permanent worker center into fruition. The workplan includes: (1) a renewal of lease with an option to own the property of the MLK Worker Center, (2) assistance in fine-tuning a business plan for a capital campaign and construction of a new MLK Worker Center building, (3) Technical assistance and funding for a planning and construction. Voz and PDC aim to have a finalized business plan and lease by mid-2015.\r\n\r\nGoal 4: The spring and summer of 2014 has seen a 10% increase in job for day laborers compared to previous years. Though we had a slim marketing budget this year, the improvement of the economy has brought more jobs and the need for day laborers. \r\n\r\nGoal 5: Though Voz has constantly faced leadership retention as leaders are lost when they land a permanent job or long term employment, Voz's leadership successfully trained a new wave of leaders in important campaigns with the city, county, state, and national issues. Day laborers were pivotal in meetings and testimonies with elected officials that led to victories in the state legislature (wage theft), securing funding from the city and county, and were key figures in rallies for not1more deportation campaign.",

      "achieved": "Raising people out of poverty through advocacy and education!  Some of our clients owe thousands of dollars in old fines which have been turned over to collection agencies.  Many of our clients do not open bank accounts for fear of having their money seized by creditors.  Old fines in collections prevent people from establishing credit, and many times no bank account or credit rating means a decent place it live, is out of their reach.  Car dealerships which offer 'no credit financing', charge interest rates as high as 36% plus they inflate the original car price by several hundred or thousand dollars before charging interest, which means the person is paying twice what the vehicle is actually worth within a two year period.  Although we are not changing the way Quick Loan companies and car dealers on 82nd Avenue do business, we are providing awareness and giving people the tools to change their financial future, and it is working! \r\n \r\nIndividuals, who have shown great progress toward reintegration, are eligible to participate in a new Red Lodge program that advocates for fine forgiveness and reduction.  All courts that the individual has ever appeared in front of, or received a fine from, are contacted.  The case number, original charge and amount of the original fine is requested.  An easy to read table is created showing the fines, charges, court, case number ect\u2026 A DMV Abstract is ordered allowing us to evaluate all tickets or fines (if license is suspended).  After all research is done, we tell the individual\u2019s story, the circumstances which brought the person to prison and what they are doing to rebuild their lives.  Letters are addressed to individual court judges; we ask that he/she meet with us to discuss options.  RLTS requests that the fines be pulled out of collections (which each judge has the authority to do), reduced, forgiven or negotiated.  We then ask the Judge that the individual be allowed to perform community service for us, in order to \u2018pay down\u2019 the fines.  Along with a letter of advocacy from Red Lodge, community letters of support are also included stating that the individual is sincere, clean and sober and working hard in every aspect of their re-entry.  What we have found with several clients is that outstanding fines can span 25 years and total thousands of dollars.\r\n  \r\nAlmost every court has responded to these letters in a positive way.  Court fines are being reduced, forgiven, negotiated and clients are being allowed to perform community service.  One client went from having over $30,000 in court fines to $8,238 in fines.  All of his fines are out of collections.  He is on a payment plan and will pay off his fines within 5 years time at a rate he can afford.  If he continues to do everything right, one judge will reconsider forgiving his largest fine in two years.  This client now has a bank account and is establishing a credit rating.  He puts $50 each paycheck into his savings which will allow him to start his own business after completing the entrepreneur class at Native American Youth and Family Center.  For each $1 dollar he saves, the program will match it with $3 dollars.  In less than three years he will have $10,000 to invest in his own business.  \r\n",

The challenges faced to fund a paid position is so labor intensive, that we may not be able to continue the program after December 2014.

W. H. did not loose his job or housing, thanks to the efforts of Red Lodge.  His Oregon Parole officer was impressed with the speed of which the problem was addressed and resolved.  M. W.

      "achieved": "Raising people out of poverty through advocacy and education!  Some of our clients owe thousands of dollars in old fines which have been turned over to collection agencies.  Many of our clients do not open bank accounts for fear of having their money seized by creditors.  Old fines in collections prevent people from establishing credit, and many times no bank account or credit rating means a decent place it live, is out of their reach.  Car dealerships which offer 'no credit financing', charge interest rates as high as 36% plus they inflate the original car price by several hundred or thousand dollars before charging interest, which means the person is paying twice what the vehicle is actually worth within a two year period.  Although we are not changing the way Quick Loan companies and car dealers on 82nd Avenue do business, we are providing awareness and giving people the tools to change their financial future, and it is working! \r\n \r\nIndividuals, who have shown great progress toward reintegration, are eligible to participate in a new Red Lodge program that advocates for fine forgiveness and reduction.  All courts that the individual has ever appeared in front of, or received a fine from, are contacted.  The case number, original charge and amount of the original fine is requested.  An easy to read table is created showing the fines, charges, court, case number ect\u2026 A DMV Abstract is ordered allowing us to evaluate all tickets or fines (if license is suspended).  After all research is done, we tell the individual\u2019s story, the circumstances which brought the person to prison and what they are doing to rebuild their lives.  Letters are addressed to individual court judges; we ask that he/she meet with us to discuss options.  RLTS requests that the fines be pulled out of collections (which each judge has the authority to do), reduced, forgiven or negotiated.  We then ask the Judge that the individual be allowed to perform community service for us, in order to \u2018pay down\u2019 the fines.  Along with a letter of advocacy from Red Lodge, community letters of support are also included stating that the individual is sincere, clean and sober and working hard in every aspect of their re-entry.  What we have found with several clients is that outstanding fines can span 25 years and total thousands of dollars.\r\n  \r\nAlmost every court has responded to these letters in a positive way.  Court fines are being reduced, forgiven, negotiated and clients are being allowed to perform community service.  One client went from having over $30,000 in court fines to $8,238 in fines.  All of his fines are out of collections.  He is on a payment plan and will pay off his fines within 5 years time at a rate he can afford.  If he continues to do everything right, one judge will reconsider forgiving his largest fine in two years.  This client now has a bank account and is establishing a credit rating.  He puts $50 each paycheck into his savings which will allow him to start his own business after completing the entrepreneur class at Native American Youth and Family Center.  For each $1 dollar he saves, the program will match it with $3 dollars.  In less than three years he will have $10,000 to invest in his own business.  \r\n",

Funding for this  position was a challenge; A livable salary for Julia Yoshimoto, Attorney at Law is being raised  through private foundation grants (not SJF), Lewis-Clark Law school fellowship program, individidual donations, and fundraisers.  The challenges faced to fund a paid position is so labor intensive, that we may not be able to continue the program after December 2014.  The Criminal Justice grant allowed us to pay for fees associated wtith background checks, DMV reinstatements, mileage reimbursement for volunteers, state issued identification, birth certificates, photocopying, court document fees, legal name changes, phone calls/video confrencing with clients who are indigent and incarcerated, and general client services.       \r\n\r\nRed Lodge Legal Services Progarm began providing direct client services to women at Coffee Creek Correactional Facility in January 2014.  To date, 22 women have been served.  Not all of their legal problems were solved, but the women who participated in the program stated they received a great deal of satisfaction and peace of mind knowing that they had explored all legal avenues and were advised of their options by a profesional attorney. \r\n\r\nKnow Your Rights traiinings were offered more frequently than we anticipated. During the summer months we have had enough special guests to offer one a month.  Everything from housing issues to employment to being stopped routinely has been addressed and explained by professionals in their field.  These trainings have proven to be an excellent source of coaltion building and community awareness.   By  reaching out to the professinal community Red Lodge helps break down barriers and stereotypes while promoting  prison reform and sound re-entry practices.  We strengthened community partnerships with the Oregon Department of Corrections, Partnership for Safety and Justice,  the Innocence Project and Lewis-Clark School of Law.   \r\n \r\n",

Every Know your Rights Training and special guest speaker is followed up with a short one page questionare which we use to evaluate the effectiveness of our programs.

RLTS is  providing direct services to  86 Native and Non-Native women at Coffee Creek Correctional Facility through six different programs.  Qualitative and subjective survey tools are used for four of the programs.  To date, we have not surveyed Sweatlodge or Talking Circle programs, but plan to work on a research tool this fall in order to do so.  \r\n\r\nWe are currently working on a Volunteer manual and formal training process for our volunteers.  Approximately 35 volunteers helped us provide meaningful culturally  appropriate programming to over 800 women and men incarcerated within the state of Oregon during the last fiscal year.  20+ volunteers are working within the prisons as religious service volunteers.  These dedicated men and women gave up 3,287 hours of their time to  the Oregon Dept. Of Corrections last year.  Out of  75 volunteers state wide, 17 of them consistently turned in volunteer program slips for projects and individuals assisted throughout our Oregon communities.

We have learned so much in regard to dealing with Interstate Compact,  negotiation of old fines admnistrative glitches which sometimes  result in people being re-arrested, transferred  and held in a county jail.  Washington State Probation and Parole function differently than Oregon, and the 'powers that be'  seem to be more resistant to answering our questions.  We were fortunate to connect with a great  Washington State  crimnal defense attorney through one of the staff members at Social Justice Fund.  Through combined efforts, and numerous phone calls, our client was returned to Oregon after 23 days of incarceration due to an administrative mishap.  Fortunately Red Lodge was able to keep his spirits up by video conferencing with him five days a week, and we kept his employer notified as well as his family who were extremely worried about him  M. W. H. did not loose his job or housing, thanks to the efforts of Red Lodge.  His Oregon Parole officer was impressed with the speed of which the problem was addressed and resolved.  M. W. H. is coming up on one year since his release, and is still doing very well.\r\n\r\n The Legal Services  Project started in January 2014, and to date our Legal Services attorney has assisted over 20 women incarcerated at Coffee Creek Correctional Facility, in Wilsonville, OR.  Various issues addressed:  Drivers license suspension, Casework Legal Research, child custody cases, visitation of children issues, return of real property, default of student loans, citizenship naturalization certificate, detainers, court fines, data collection, community support efforts, meetings and networking.  \r\n\r\nRe-entry and and the Law sessions began in January.  We had experts in their field come in and speak to the women on the minimum unit about fair housing practices, employment issues, how to fill out a job application and answer questions about felony convictions ect...  the most inspiring class thus far has been in regard to knowing and exercising our rights with law enforcement officers stopping people  on the streets or during routine traffic stops.

This grant has especially deep meaning to us because it came from individual donors and communities who share common values and the courage to create a different system of resource sharing and distribution. \r\n\r\nIt was also very powerful for EJGP members Avery Kirsten, Kim Berandi, and Kylie Gursky to come to Johnny Buck\u2019s Wanapum community in central Washington.  This was a critical first step in a reciprocal relationship.  More often NYLA fellows are asked to come to Seattle without urban-based leaders also coming to rural communities to get a sense first hand of community dynamics and ways of life.  We appreciate this foundational approach to cross-cultural organizing.\r\n\r\nThe flexibility of having general operating funds to invest during this grant period made all the difference to supporting the most impact from these financial resources and yielded a clarified focus in NYLA\u2019s organizing work, focusing on land issues related to Treaty Rights.\r\n\r\nWe are excited to share and reflect our year with EJGP and are grateful for all your support:\r\n\r\n\u2022\tFOOD SOVEREIGNTY NORTHWEST INDIAN COLLEGE PARTNERSHIP MURAL PROJECT\r\n\r\nWith the EJGP investment, NYLA brought to fruition a collaborative, community mural project! We partnered with Northwest Indian College (NWIC) Center for Indigenous Service Learning, NWIC students, local community and our NYLA fellows took lead to navigate this project to realization (see attached photos!). NWIC student, Phillip Solomon (Lummi) was our lead artist with, Roger Fernandes (Lower Elwah) as our mentoring artist.\r\n\r\nThe mural came to life through the collective visioning of NYLA fellows, NWIC students, and from our lead and mentor artists. The mural depicts an intertribal welcoming, giving thanks for a new day, honoring Northwest Native plants and landscape. The mural is in honor of the late, Billy Frank Jr. (Nisqually) and includes one of his celebrated quotes, \u201cEvery time we carry an eagle feather, that\u2019s sovereignty. Every time we pick berries, that\u2019s sovereignty. Every time we dig roots, that\u2019s sovereignty.\u201d We will officially mount the mural and name it this Fall 2014 when NWIC students return.  \r\n\r\nThis mural strengthened a key long-term partnership with Northwest Indian College, and addressed root issues of reversing internalized oppression by fostering intertribal collaboration as well as treaty rights issues related to food sovereignty and land rights.   This mural is the foundation to engage broader networks of young leaders connected to NYLA through NWIC and to foster an expanded partnership with NWIC to ATNI. \r\n\r\n\u2022\tAFFILIATED TRIBES OF NORTHWEST INDIANS: YOUTH COMMITTEE + YOUTH ADVOCACY FORUM\r\n\r\nNYLA strengthened partnerships with Affiliated Tribes of Northwest Indians (ATNI) and continued to build a strong foundation for the ATNI Youth Committee through co-chair, Johnny Buck and support of Mariana Harvey, Sophia Kizilbash, Paul Cline, Noelani Villa and Makai Lewis. We presented at the General Assembly of Tribal Leaders across Northwest Indian Country at the past 3 ATNI gatherings; offering models of sustainable, holistic, intergenerational leadership to support life long leaders.\r\n\r\nATNI is a key partnership because of its collaborative power of Tribal leaders from 64 Tribes across the Northwest.  Young leaders and youth voices are absent from ATNI policy making and advocacy, despite the demographic reality that Native communities are trending younger. \r\n\r\nWith this investment, NYLA is positioned to expand our advocacy and policy making ability by connecting generations through the ATNI Youth Advocacy Forum.  To accomplish this, NYLA has built partnerships with Tribal leaders from the Confederated Tribes of the Umatilla Indian Reservation (CTUIR) to co-host, plan and coordinate the ATNI Fall 2014 Youth Forum focusing on advocacy, youth activism, and treaty rights that will impact the youth of the 64 ATNI member tribes.\r\n\r\n\u2022\tINCREASED CAPACITY OF NYLA FELLOWS TO STRENGTHEN COLLABORATIVE PARTNERSHIPS AND TO LEAD NYLA AS AN ORGANIZATION\r\n\r\nWith the support of general operating funds from EJGP, NYLA has increased capacity to intentionally support four fellows Mariana Harvey, Johnny Buck, Amy Stiffarm & Burdette Birdinground to lead NYLA as an organization.  \r\n\r\nMariana Harvey is serving NYLA as the Northwest Leadership Program Manager, Amy Stiffarm is leading expansion of NYLA Montana, Johnny Buck is leading relationships and community building across the Northwest and nationally including with the Native Organizing Alliance, First Stewards and Burdette Birdinground is supporting fellows\u2019 organizing focus and collaborations. \r\n\r\n\u2022\tCLARIFIED ORGANIZING FOCUS ON TREATY RIGHTS RELATED TO LAND AND FOOD SOVEREIGNTY\r\n\r\nThis year\u2019s investment supported us to bring the common lens of our organizing into clearer focus.  This common lens of our NYLA collaborative organizing work related to environment justice are treaty rights and the resulting land, food and health equity rights afforded to us in our treaties that are in need to be protected and defended.  Key milestones to advance our organizing work for treaty rights this year have come in the form of strategic relationships, specifically through the ATNI network of Tribal leaders.  NYLA is intentionally growing a partnership with Micah McCarty, Board Chair of First Stewards (United Indigenous Voices Address Sustainability and Adaptability to Climate Change, www.firststewards.org); Special Advisor on Tribal Relations to the President of Evergreen College; and former Tribal Council Chairman of the Makah Tribe.  NYLA is focusing a strategic partnership on Indigenous approaches to organizing for climate justice.  Our strategy development includes methods to hold state institutions such as the Washington Fish and Wildlife Department accountable to ensure treaty rights are upheld and that land rights such as protecting sacred sites are honored. \r\n \r\nThank you for this opportunity to share back and reflect with this report.  This supports us to complete this second cycle of learning and partnership, and we hope it does the same for all who made this investment happen.\r\n",

      "goal_progress": "\r\nAchieved and Ongoing\u2014\r\n\r\nGoal 1: Change How Child Welfare and Family Law Court Systems Engage with Incarcerated Women by Getting Legal Information and Access to Representation.\r\nIn collaboration with formerly incarcerated parents and the Prison Doula Project, IMAP will provide women access to information necessary to advocate on behalf of themselves to ensure that our child welfare and family law court systems give them real opportunities to maintain their parental relationships through:\r\n\r\nQ&A Sessions, Domestic Violence Relationship Skills Courses, Legal Library Office Hours, Family Law Legal Clinic (see answer to first question above for more detail).\r\n\r\nOngoing--\r\nGoal 2: Creating Systemic Change Through Leadership Training Directed at Engaging Incarcerated Women in the Political Process\r\nIn order to thoughtfully and effectively engage incarcerated women to develop strategies for systemic change, we are collaborating with Women on the Rise Telling HERstory (WORTH). WORTH is an advocacy and consulting group comprised of currently and formerly incarcerated women who will train our formerly incarcerated and currently incarcerated parents with the goal to create a policy initiative or directive that comes from the women themselves. The trainings will include looking at the larger social, political and economic systems that work to their disadvantage and coming up with effective solutions.\r\n\r\nExplanation: \r\nAlthough we envisioned planning and implementing the training with WORTH in the 2013-2014 grant cycle, once we began working on planning, we realized that using this first year to build rapport with Tina Reynolds at WORTH, further develop leadership with the incarcerated women and create systems to involve the women in the planning process and create the training program itself, was the best use of our time. In planning with Tina, we decided that two one-week trainings would be preferable, as it would allow her to build trust and gain rapport with the individuals participating in the training. It will also time well, as part of the first training will be to start developing an idea for policy/advocacy action, and the second training will work on helping individuals implement that goal. Therefore the funds we received for the 2013-2014 grant cycle have been used pay for travel for Tina and a colleague from New York, their stay in Seattle, as well as pay the consulting fees for WORTHs first visit in December 2014, and the second training in Spring 2015. The second session is timed for during the legislative session in hopes that if we have a bill we are supporting that has achieved sponsorship (or has a been introduced by a legislator).\r\n\r\nAlso, in postponing the training, we were able to solicit policy suggestions via the survey we distributed, to get an idea of what type of policy solutions women wish to see in order to offer substantive working sessions to be included in the training. One issue that women have told IMAP that they are interested in addressing is open adoption.  Open adoption is an option given to women instead of proceeding to a termination trial, where if they don\u2019t win at trial they risk losing their children permanently. The open adoption agreement allows women to prevent the trial from taking place, and instead they enter into an agreement with the adoptive parents that allows for the birth parent\u2019s continued involvement in the child\u2019s life. Unfortunately, many women are unable to enforce any agreements they make, resulting in a false contract signed leading to permanent separation from their children. IMAP leadership, in particular Lillian Hewko, was able to work with the Office of Public Defense, a former Assistant Attorney General (individuals usually charged with terminating parental rights and overseeing these agreements), and other child welfare policy leaders to draft a plan and possible legislative fixes for the 2014-2015 legislative session. We also began the process of developing policy ideas in regard to this issue through collaboration with formerly incarcerated mothers.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, in the opportunity to work with Tacoma-Pierce County Bar Association Volunteer Legal Services Program was a great use of our time and an opportunity to build even greater leadership from within. \r\n",

      "summarize_last_year": "Over the last year, not only were we were able to continue and sustain the work we were already doing, but thanks to the grant, we were able to implement and begin steps on two major programmatic aspects of our work that serve to build leadership and opportunities for organizing by incarcerated women and formerly incarcerated women. The first of those programs was contemplated in the grant process: creating a leadership, policy and advocacy training led by formerly incarcerated women at Women on the Rise Telling HERstory (WORTH). The second program is a family law legal clinic run by Lindy Laurence, a paralegal who is also a formerly incarcerated woman.\r\n\r\nAs you may remember, in our grant proposal we planned to use the funds to collaborate with Women on the Rise Telling HERstory (Worth). Worth is an advocacy and consulting group comprised of currently and formerly incarcerated women who will train our formerly incarcerated and currently incarcerated parents with the goal to create a policy initiative or directive that comes from the women themselves. WORTH is a small organization led and run by Tina Reynolds. IMAP originally began working with WORTH in connection to our work with the Prison Doula Project (formerly the Birth Attendants, Olympia, WA) when planning and facilitating a panel workshop at the Civil Liberties and Public Policy Conference in Spring 2013 at Hampshire College. Thanks to the funding, we have been able to work with Tina to help her and her staff to develop an Organizing Toolkit tailored to Washington State. Additionally, we have been working with WORTH to tailor a two part policy and advocacy training for December 2014 and Spring 2015. With WORTH, IMAP has created a Legislative Overview of WA state that delineates the allies in Washington State that helped us work on the Children of Incarcerated Parents Bill (a bill passed in 2013 where women at WCCW and MCCCW participated in direct advocacy sending letters to WA state legislators that included personal stories as well as poems about the separation and loss experienced by individuals in women\u2019s prisons). This was necessary so that together WORTH and IMAP could determine who our policy \"champions\" would be on a future policy changes we seek to bring forth.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs part of the trainings, we have asked Tina to include Prison Abolition ideals and build into the training critical thinking about prison systems and other institutional structures that break communities down. We would like the training to include thinking about ways we can work to shift our attention to building communities and that which actually helps make communities safe, such as: adequate schools, housing, mental health services, and keeping families facing poverty, mental health and trauma from facing the trauma of incarceration and to the trauma of being separated from their loved ones and their community. \r\n\r\nWe created a survey in order to ensure the women at Washington Corrections Center for Women (WCCW) and Mission Creek Corrections Center for Women (MCCCW) are shaping and designing the training. The survey included questions about what changes they wish to see in the criminal justice and/or child welfare systems; experience in the child welfare system, including contact with their children, where children are placed etc.; personal experience with foster care, being raised by relatives, family friends etc.; learning styles; level of interest and self-assessment of current policy knowledge/experience; leadership skills most interested in gaining; and interest in creating a woman\u2019s forum down the line. The last question is to gauge interest in whether along with WORTH we can help develop opportunities for community organizing by bring women from the community to the prison--some who have been personally impacted by prison, others who work in social service organization or have been affected personally by prisons, to come together and share their experiences, resources and work together. We asked individuals whether this would be something helpful for them, and what exactly would they want out of this experience.\r\n\r\nThe second programmatic aspect we have added has developed through an introduction between IMAP leader Beth Leonard, former student leader and now attorney at the King County Bar Association Pro Bono Counsel in Seattle, Washington, and Lindy Laurence, Paralegal and Volunteer & Clinic Coordinator at the Tacoma-Pierce County Bar Association Volunteer Legal Services Program (VLS). Beth and Lindy discussed the gap in legal services for women in prison and conceived of bringing the volunteer legal services program to the prison. Lindy is a formerly incarcerated woman, and is now serving as an advisory board member for IMAP. Lindy is in charge of the logistics of the monthly Family Law Clinic at WCCW, recruiting volunteers, and planning with Tacoma VLS staff. She is also helping us create structure for our Formerly Incarcerated Mothers Advisory Committee. \r\n\r\nIn addition to these programmatic aspects, we have also implemented legal trainings by IMAP for the WCCW prison legal library clerks. We have instituted a group we are calling \u201cBig IMAP\u201d or BIMAP. This group helps with facilitating administrative and programmatic strategic planning, including funding, and larger organizational structure among volunteers from both law schools, the community, re-entry, and formerly incarcerated members. This group will also be having a retreat in Fall 2014.\r\n",

      "goal_progress": "Post Office Organizing & Visibility\r\nIn October, ROP arranged an Op-Ed tour with retired letter carrier, Jamie Partridge. Jamie visited 7 small-town communities, met with local newspapers and got articles in the local papers about saving the post office.  Following from the tour, an additional four communities also ran Op-Eds in their local papers.  Op-Eds focused on an \u201caspirational view\u201d of the post office, inviting readers to consider what role the post office could play in meeting the needs of small town communities, from postal banking to one-stop-shopping for government services.  As the last standing piece of public infrastructure in many small town communities, centering a pro-active vision around this key institution made perfect sense for promoting an alternative vision of what could be.\r\n\r\nWe experimented with a regional action at the Springfield Mail Processing Center. 70 folks packed the sidewalk in front of the post office at the Springfield Mail Processing Center (slated to close in February) on the busiest day of the year for the USPS, talking with customers, sharing homebaked goodies, political songs, and our collective vision of what the United States Postal Service should be. We kicked off with ROP setting the tone with the message: \u201cWe want to see the postal service evolve to meet our communities' needs\u201d \u2013 sharing not only our \"no cuts\" message, but also an aspirational view of small town post offices and the USPS. Every local news station covered it that evening, and we were the front-page article (above the fold!) in the largest paper in the region.  The Ed Schultz Show on MSNBC not only covered the action in depth on national television, but actually used our language about how privatization is playing out with the Right\u2019s intentional destabilization of the United States Postal Service, emphasizing that we are in a moment where we need more services not less. APWU National President Mark Dimondstein said that he hopes to see other states following in Oregon's footsteps.  View the Ed Schultz Show here: http://www.msnbc.com/the-ed-show/watch/fight-to-save-the-usps-from-extinction-95999555933\r\nExpanding our vision of the \u201cCommons\u201d: Group by group conversations\r\nAs we continued to mobilize and organize to save the USPS, ROP also used a group-by-group strategy to expand our Post Office organizing into a broader effort addressing our eroding public commons and creating a vision of vibrant and inclusive communities. (We define \u201cCommons\u201d as what we hold in common, from social services to our environment.) We knew that the fight for post offices and other services could be an opportunity to insert a vision for what our communities might look like in the coming decades.  ROP used living room conversations and support of several local organizing strategies with multiple communities to build a broader analysis and frame among our groups.  \r\nOur in-community \u201cCommons\u201d conversations started with the question, \u201cWhat do you need to live in this community 10 or 20 years from now?\u201d And then moved to topics like: \u201cWe're going to need to rely on each other more as our safety nets erode around us, so how do we do that?\u201d and \u201cWho is included, safe, and has their needs met in our communities? Who doesn't?\u201d\r\n\r\nIt was when we asked the question about who is included that conversations turned to what race and racism looks like in their counties. Many conversations revealed the white supremacist organizing happening in their county, sometimes resulting in hate activity or forcing families of color out of town. In addition, many exposed that immigration stays a safe way for the Right to talk about race and exclusion. What started as conversations about what we need to keep living in our communities 10 or 20 years from now moved to explicit analysis around race, racism and racial justice in small town Oregon. \r\n\r\nThrough the process of the living room conversations, ROP and our member human dignity groups built consensus in order to have a functioning \u201ccommons,\u201d we need to provide an alternative vision for our communities that challenges the exclusionary and racist vision promoted by the Right and address race and racism head on.  ROP then shifted our organizing strategy to engage more deeply around the intersections between racism, racial justice and economic justice.  This strategy also allowed us to weave together our economic justice organizing work with our Safe & Welcoming Communities work (addressing criminalization of immigrants).   \r\n\r\nBeginning in January of 2014, organizers fanned out across the state to do check-ins focused on drawing out the county storyline around race and racism, and engaging groups to build local capacity through organizing work in 2014 (and beyond) that directly address the following questions: \r\nWhat would it take for you to be able to be in this community 10 or 20 years from now? Who is included and who is not in your community?\r\nWe think we are seeing a rise in hate crimes around the state, are you seeing anything in your community? If there was a hate crime, would your group be equipped to respond?\r\nWhat kinds of conversations are going on around the driver's card/immigration debate/ deportations in your county? How is the debate around the driver\u2019s card being framed? What do you think the best strategy is for your group to frame the conversation in terms of human dignity?\r\n\r\nROP will reach every group with this conversation by the end of 2014.  We have already engaged 35 human dignity groups.\r\n\r\nRural Caucus & Strategy Session\r\n\r\nThis year\u2019s Rural Caucus & Strategy Session brought together over 100 people and featured a session on:\r\n \u201cIt Takes a Movement to Protect Your Home and Community\u201d\r\nIn a moment when it is revolutionary to take care of each other, rural Oregonians are leading the way! Together we will learn about three grassroots movements to protect the right to live free from fear of losing the place you call home, including foreclosures, rural emergency response, and deportations, and discuss organizing strategies for building people-powered systems that hold our rural communities together and keep our neighbors safe. \r\n\r\nThe outcomes were powerful and profound, with strategies and ideas on how to integrate our work with the \u201cCommons\u201d and racial justice to better address the needs of small town communities and directly take on corporate power and Extreme Right scapegoating.\r\n\r\nLocal Organizing:\r\nROP\u2019s work is rooted by deeply engaging local leadership in small town communities, building relationships and then engaging over the long-term.  The impact of our work is often times best summarized through the storytelling of local organizing.  Here is one example of our \u201cCommons\u201d organizing in the last year that gives texture to what rural organizing looks like within ROP and our member human dignity groups.  Please see question #4 for more details.\r\n\r\nCottage Grove Emergency Response: In February, the worst ice storm to hit Lane County in 100 years rocked some of the most rural communities in Western Oregon, resulting in hundreds of thousands of rural Oregonians without power for over a week, some for much longer in freezing conditions. When local human dignity group leaders who had been trapped because of downed trees and power lines realized that first responders, like the Fire Department, weren't coming when called, we decided to try organizing a very basic emergency response team to check up on neighbors. With freezing temperatures and no electricity, rural folks on wells don't have access to water, nor do their livestock. Together, we found that the County had no emergency response plan, had no idea folks were without water and firewood, and, they even tried blowing us off, telling us that Eugene, the major urban center in Lane County, was fine so no one else needed emergency services. Within 24 hours, we went on the news, looking like a huge force of broad community support, which forced the County to open a hotline for folks to receive food, water, firewood, or emergency shelter. We kept the pressure on and made them keep the hotline open 24 hours over several days. Later, we convened local first responders, Police, Fire, etc., to ask why they weren't communicating effectively, which has resulted in the PUD training the Fire Department how to use their equipment so fire fighters could actually go in and help folks trapped by down power lines. We later held a community forum where folks from every political ideology and corner of the community surrounding Cottage Grove came together and brainstormed structures and functions for ongoing emergency response work.  As folks in Cottage Grove advance their local human dignity group organizing there is a heightened awareness and collective identity of need for community infrastructure that meets immediate needs and safety, and will shape the organizing priorities and strategies moving forward.\r\n\r\nShifts in our plans: During our final Strategic Planning Retreat, our Board of Directors (who is made up of local human dignity group leaders) identified the most important work that ROP does as local, in-community work with human dignity groups. As a result, ROP shifted our focus on holding regional convenings to prioritizing in-community conversations and local organizing support with member groups.  We kept the regional convenings as a possibility for places where it made sense and held 2 regional events: a regional convening in Central Oregon and our Springfield Action at the Mail Processing Plan\r\n",

      "evaluation": "One of the most important aspects of our work is the local human dignity group organizing.  We mentioned above that ROP worked with groups in five counties on local \u201cCommons\u201d organizing efforts and \u201ccoaching\u201d for one rural network. These included:\r\n\r\n\u2022\tCottage Grove: Rural Emergency Response \r\n\u2022\tColumbia County Economic Development \u2013 challenging coal, oil and methanol trains and export\r\n\u2022\tJosephine County: Building a Commons for All by advancing local racial justice organizing\r\n\u2022\tKlamath County: Fighting Corporate Power (literally by exploring a Municipal Utility District)\r\n\u2022\tDouglas County: Feed the Berg \u2013 organizing for basic rights of those who are not housed\r\n\u2022\tOrganizing support for Community Rights campaigns, an effort to give rights to local communities to protect health of community and environment, which is taking off in Oregon, in coordination with Community Environmental Legal Defense Fund (which provides the legal support).

Please do contact us if you would like us to elaborate on any of the other powerful local organizing efforts on the \u201cCommons.\u201d\r\n\r\nRural Community Emergency Response \r\n \r\nAs the aftermath of the deadly mudslide in Oso, Washington unfold, rural emergency response is topic of many conversations happening across the country. Human dignity organizers in Cottage Grove are mulling that same topic since February after responding to the aftermath of the worst ice storm in Lane County history that left thousands without power for over a week and many of the most isolated families in the County without the means of leaving their properties for food, water, and supplies.\r\n\r\nWhat I thought was a brief visit with my family in Cottage Grove turned into a week-long adventure in figuring out an all-volunteer emergency response. The experience left me and others in my community wondering: what role does emergency response play in our movement for human dignity? Do you and your human dignity group know what you would do in an emergency? \r\n\r\nI don't have the answers, but I do know that when crisis struck close to home, I had other human dignity leaders in Cottage Grove to learn alongside and experiment with as neighbors tried to take care of neighbors on the fly. We strategically leveraged power to make county-wide shifts and two months later, our core team of 8 dedicated folks are figuring out how we can prepare ourselves to do better next time -- because there will be a next time. Read more below!\r\n  \r\nIt has been an honor to organize alongside such incredible folks! Thank you, Cristina, Spenser, Melinda, Kevin, Bedo, Steve, Ivan, Trish, Jimmy, Janetta, and the dozens of others who pitched in and made things happen! You all inspire me with your brilliance, generosity, and spirit of justice!\r\n \r\nIs emergency response or disaster planning something your group or community are discussing? \r\n\r\nMarch 27, 2014\r\n\r\nI was visiting my family in Cottage Grove in February when we got some impressive weather: first snow, and then several inches of freezing rain. Trees weighed down by inches of ice were breaking and falling (see the photo above -- weighed down with two inches of ice, those fir trees look like they belong in a Dr. Seuss book). Friday evening we lost power. The next morning we saw that we had a snapped utility pole and half a mile of uninsulated high-voltage powerlines blocking our only road on or off of our rural property. \r\n\r\nThree days later, we had used up our recommended 3-day emergency kit of food, water, and propane for heat. Our utility, a beloved Public Utility District, was so slammed that we couldn't get a call through their system and resorted to Twitter and Facebook to notify them of our outage. Over 12,000 people were without power in our PUD alone -- over half of their customers -- and, being a small PUD that only serves rural parts of Lane County, they didn't have the capacity to respond quickly. Without any estimates of when we'd see a crew, I climbed over the snapped utility pole and power lines to walk the several miles to town for supplies.\r\n \r\nOnce I got to town, I saw the magnitude of what had happened. The entire town of Cottage Grove was hurting, and every local store had sold out of propane. Without a source of heat, I put out a plea on Facebook and one of my friends, an incredible Occupy Cottage Grove organizer, responded in less than thirty seconds that he'd pick me up and help me problem-solve. Ultimately, he gave me his extra propane canisters and gave me a ride as close as he could to home.\r\n \r\nMonday, we called the fire department. They said they'd come out and move the snapped eletrical pole so we could drive out to town... But the fire department ended up calling the PUD first, and the PUD told them they would restore power to our area that day -- boy were they wrong! By the end of the day, over 9,000 folks were still without power and it was clear we weren't going to be helped. My mom, my brother, and I got our dogs and hiked out over those down power lines to town.\r\n \r\nWe are extremely privileged. We are able-bodied and, even though it was a hard hit, we could afford a hotel in town for four more nights. It soon became clear that many other folks weren't so privileged -- already isolated families were trapped by live lines or trees and couldn't get out, couldn't get water or groceries, had ran out of firewood or propane, and no one was responding to their pleas for help. You could watch the PUD's Facebook page for up-to-the-minute updates of people whose livestock were starving or without water (well pumps don't work without electricity and the temperatures were still below freezing), or who were relying on generators for their medical equipment and were almost out of gas. What about the folks who had no way to charge their phones?\r\n \r\nI put out a note out on Facebook seeing if folks wanted to get together to talk about what we could do, and soon a small team of folks formed. Folks from Occupy Cottage Grove, ForestWeb, and Blackberry Pie Society pulled together to set up our \"office\" in the local bakery-by-day, bar-by-night and got to work. I ran between City Hall, dropping in on the City Manager and Public Works, and the Bookmine, owned by our allies and local human dignity group organizers, rounding up folks to help brainstorm next steps.\r\n \r\nSoon we had the name of the folks at the County level who were supposed to be responding to emergency needs, but weren't. The County said they weren't aware of any needs. They were shocked when we explained that people were on day five of no electricity and no water, isolated because of trees and power lines in the road. The county actually told us \"Eugene is okay so Lane County doesn't need to respond\". What?! We left Senator Prozanski a voicemail asking him to help put some pressure on and got a quick reply that his office was learning hard on the County to begin providing some basic relief.\r\n \r\nAfter a day of investigating and discovering no agency was actually aware of the reality in rural Lane County, we called for a meeting that evening to plan our next steps. A hand-full of area human dignity group organizers gathered and we quickly ironed out a plan to do our own emergency response. We would find information any way we could -- folks were screaming on the utilities' Facebook pages at this point, so that was one source of information -- and we would send a team out to knock on doors. If we couldn't get to their door, we would cut the tree or the utility pole out of the way. If they needed something we didn't already have in the vehicle, we would problem solve that from our \"office\".\r\n\r\nWe already had the Humane Society on board with extra pet food, and the Hay Bank ready in case we encountered hungry livestock. While one organizer called the local newspaper editor to see if he could get us more detailed information on who needed help, another couple organizers ran to the bar to announce that we needed volunteers during a Habitat for Humanity fundraiser. Soon we had a list of our first incredible volunteers, which included medics, drivers, and folks who were ready to use their chainsaws!\r\n \r\nAt that same meeting we got our local PUD board member on the phone at the suggestion of one of our core organizers, who also happens to be his neighbor. Once on the phone, he committed to holding the PUD's feet to the fire. The PUD was clearly way under capacity to respond and it was time to ask for help. In the mean time, the PUD definitely needed to stop calling off the fire department -- that's a silly mistake to make in the name of PR that could cost people their lives.\r\n\r\nWe left that meeting sharing why we had spent 12-18 hours that day fact-finding and organizing around this. One organizer remarked, \"these are the moments where we are able obviously justify building community -- it really could become a matter of life or death.\" Another said, \"this is a wake-up call. As our safety nets fall apart, it is going to be up to us to hold each other up. If we say we are for human dignity, we need to make sure our community is there for each other to make sure no one's safety is at risk.\"\r\n \r\nThe next morning we met at our \"office\" and got our team ready for the media to arrive. We explained to the news crew that we felt we needed to act because neighbors need to take care of neighbors in these situations, because if we don't take care of each other, who else will? While I took the news crew up to our property -- an example of one family's needs not being met, and look at that, it's my home, how convenient! -- the crew in town assembled a van-load of firewood, cases of water, and got a team of volunteers together to go out to check on folks who had been without power for six days. The news crew returned just in time to follow them out as they began canvassing rural streets to see what needs neighbors had! For only having five people activated that morning, the news segment made us look big and powerful -- just as we had hoped! Click here to watch the news segment -- the top news story for that evening.\r\n\r\nThis is where we began seeing real successes! The County, under pressure from the media and Sen. Prozanski's office, put up a 211 line for a few hours and began providing real relief to trapped families, delivering food, water, firewood, and propane. We kept the pressure on by publicly asking hard questions: the County is advertising the 211 line on the news -- what happens if you don't have electricity to watch the news? One day isn't good enough, will you open the 211 line again tomorrow and the next day? The County responded by keeping their line open overnight and through the next days.\r\n \r\nSecondly, we leaned on the County and the state to declare an emergency in order to prioritize getting additional utility crews out immediately. We mobilized our new relationships with our local PUD board member and Sen. Prozanski's office to help us move the idea. Soon utility crews were pouring in from across the state to restore power!\r\n \r\nThe next week, we sat down together to figure out what happens next. We just had this experience where we identified a gigantic hole in our safety net. We tried our best to problem-solve in the moment and just a few of us managed to get the County to move, the state to move, and built some strategic relationships along the way. Luckily we had a solid network of human dignity organizers to mobilize, because who knows how difficult it would have been to respond without that community infrastructure already in place!\r\n \r\nAfter a couple of hours of asking each other tough questions, we came out resolved that we want to try to figure out a rural neighbor-to-neighbor response that allows us to meet each others needs without relying on agencies who may not be able to respond. We also left with some clarity that we wanted to spend some time figuring out how to respond in an economic crisis (what if folks can't afford the gas to get their food boxes from the food bank? It happened back in 2008) or, god forbid, a hate crime.\r\n \r\nLeaving that meeting with more questions than answers, we began planning some fact-finding roundtables! We continue to be puzzled about how decisions are made about emergency response (who is prioritized and how?), and even the agencies we spoke to during the ice storm fall-out seemed just as puzzled as us. Several encouraged us to get them rounded up to have a conversation, so we are! Next Tuesday we will hold our first roundtable where local leaders will sit alongside different government agencies that play a role in disaster response, such as the City, the County, the rural fire department, etc. Each agency will share its role is in emergencies, who they communicate with, and how decisions are made internally and regionally. Together we will map out ways to work together more effectively, including prioritizing rural, isolated, and low-income areas for response -- the folks who were helped last after the ice storm, and who will continue to be helped last unless we confront it.\r\n\r\nOn the horizon is another roundtable to dive into what kind of response our community wants to build, which will convene community groups ranging from the Kiwanis to the Granges to churches. In the mean time, they are encouraging us as Cottage Grove residents to band together to make sure our neighbors are prepared to take care of each other.\r\n\r\nAre you a member of a Community Emergency Response Team? Is your local community organizing around disaster preparedness? ",

We appreciate the funding model, and the opportunity to share our ideas, and have those influence the grantmaking process.\r\n\r\nThe only constructive feedback we have is around the rural/ urban dynamic.  We find that many of the participants (all?) in the giving projects are from urban communities.  There is a huge difference in rural vs. urban organizing and we find that there is a gap in that understanding.  How can ROP help with that? How might we better deepen and engage the understanding of rural organizing among those that participate in SJF?  It is hard to fit that into a grant proposal along with the other requested and necessary information.\r\n\r\nThank you as always for the opportunity to work together.  Much respect and admiration your way. \r\n",
