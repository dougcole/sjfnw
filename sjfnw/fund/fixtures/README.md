# Fund fixtures

Most tests use `test_fund.json` which provides a small set of objects for the 'first' user. (See [test case docs](https://github.com/aisapatino/sjfnw/blob/master/docs/tests/test-classes.md#first) for more information).

The rest of the fixtures were generated using http://www.json-generator.com.
