			<ul><li>Attempt again with the same email, but make sure you enter the password that you used for Project Central.</li>
			<li>Use a different email address to sign up.</li>
			<li>If you need to use the same email address, but don't have access to your password, you can reset it <a href="/fund/reset">here</a>.</li></ul>
