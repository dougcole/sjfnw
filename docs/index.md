### Getting started

Follow the table of contents to get a local development environment set up, starting with [installation and setup](getting-started/installation-and-setup.md).

The [resources](resources.md) page has links with more info on the various languages/platforms/technologies that are used.

### Finding tasks to work on

Look for [issues labeled "ready"](https://github.com/aisapatino/sjfnw/labels/ready) - they should be relatively self-contained and have some information in the description. Contact Aisa on slack or post a comment on the issue if you need clarification.

### Contribute to docs

If you notice anything missing/wrong in the docs, please [file an issue](https://github.com/aisapatino/sjfnw/issues/new) or make the change yourself and submit a PR! For more info on how to update the docs, see the [documentation](./about/docs.md) page.
