Most support requests go through staff, but sometimes we're contacted directly via the techsupport email or the online support forms. By far the most common issue is forgotten passwords or needing to change the login email.

### Forgotten password

Do they still have access to the same email address they used to sign up?
- If so, direct them to [sjf-nw.appspot.com/apply/reset](https://sjf-nw.appspot.com/apply/reset) where they can reset their password.
- If not, you'll need to change their email address - see below.

### Changing an org's login email

    - Save
2. Change email of `Organization`
